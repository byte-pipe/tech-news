Remote Control is available as a research preview on Pro and Max plans. It is not available on Team or Enterprise plans.

Remote Control connects
claude.ai/code
 or the Claude app for
iOS
 and
Android
 to a Claude Code session running on your machine. Start a task at your desk, then pick it up from your phone on the couch or a browser on another computer.

When you start a Remote Control session on your machine, Claude keeps running locally the entire time, so nothing moves to the cloud. With Remote Control you can:

* Use your full local environment remotely: your filesystem,MCP servers, tools, and project configuration all stay available
* Work from both surfaces at once: the conversation stays in sync across all connected devices, so you can send messages from your terminal, browser, and phone interchangeably
* Survive interruptions: if your laptop sleeps or your network drops, the session reconnects automatically when your machine comes back online

Unlike
Claude Code on the web
, which runs on cloud infrastructure, Remote Control sessions run directly on your machine and interact with your local filesystem. The web and mobile interfaces are just a window into that local session.

This page covers setup, how to start and connect to sessions, and how Remote Control compares to Claude Code on the web.

## ​Requirements

Before using Remote Control, confirm that your environment meets these conditions:

* Subscription: requires a Pro or Max plan. API keys are not supported.
* Authentication: runclaudeand use/loginto sign in through claude.ai if you haven’t already.
* Workspace trust: runclaudein your project directory at least once to accept the workspace trust dialog.

## ​Start a Remote Control session

You can start a new session directly in Remote Control, or connect a session that’s already running.

* New session
* From an existing session
Navigate to your project directory and run:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
claude
 remote-control

The process stays running in your terminal, waiting for remote connections. It displays a session URL you can use to
connect from another device
, and you can press spacebar to show a QR code for quick access from your phone. While a remote session is active, the terminal shows connection status and tool activity.
This command supports the following flags:
* --verbose: show detailed connection and session logs
* --sandbox/--no-sandbox: enable or disablesandboxingfor filesystem and network isolation during the session. Sandboxing is off by default.
If you’re already in a Claude Code session and want to continue it remotely, use the
/remote-control
 (or
/rc
) command:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
/remote-control

This starts a Remote Control session that carries over your current conversation history and displays a session URL and QR code you can use to
connect from another device
. The
--verbose
,
--sandbox
, and
--no-sandbox
 flags are not available with this command.
Use
/rename
 before running
/remote-control
 to give the session a descriptive name. This makes it easier to find in the session list across devices.

### ​Connect from another device

Once a Remote Control session is active, you have a few ways to connect from another device:

* Open the session URLin any browser to go directly to the session onclaude.ai/code. Bothclaude remote-controland/remote-controldisplay this URL in the terminal.
* Scan the QR codeshown alongside the session URL to open it directly in the Claude app. Withclaude remote-control, press spacebar to toggle the QR code display.
* Openclaude.ai/codeor the Claude appand find the session by name in the session list. Remote Control sessions show a computer icon with a green status dot when online.

The remote session takes its name from your last message, your
/rename
 value, or “Remote Control session” if there’s no conversation history. If the environment already has an active session, you’ll be asked whether to continue it or start a new one.

If you don’t have the Claude app yet, use the
/mobile
 command inside Claude Code to display a download QR code for
iOS
 or
Android
.

### ​Enable Remote Control for all sessions

By default, Remote Control only activates when you explicitly run
claude remote-control
 or
/remote-control
. To enable it automatically for every session, run
/config
 inside Claude Code and set
Enable Remote Control for all sessions
 to
true
. Set it back to
false
 to disable.

Each Claude Code instance supports one remote session at a time. If you run multiple instances, each one gets its own environment and session.

## ​Connection and security

Your local Claude Code session makes outbound HTTPS requests only and never opens inbound ports on your machine. When you start Remote Control, it registers with the Anthropic API and polls for work. When you connect from another device, the server routes messages between the web or mobile client and your local session over a streaming connection.

All traffic travels through the Anthropic API over TLS, the same transport security as any Claude Code session. The connection uses multiple short-lived credentials, each scoped to a single purpose and expiring independently.

## ​Remote Control vs Claude Code on the web

Remote Control and
Claude Code on the web
 both use the claude.ai/code interface. The key difference is where the session runs: Remote Control executes on your machine, so your local MCP servers, tools, and project configuration stay available. Claude Code on the web executes in Anthropic-managed cloud infrastructure.

Use Remote Control when you’re in the middle of local work and want to keep going from another device. Use Claude Code on the web when you want to kick off a task without any local setup, work on a repo you don’t have cloned, or run multiple tasks in parallel.

## ​Limitations

* One remote session at a time: each Claude Code session supports one remote connection.
* Terminal must stay open: Remote Control runs as a local process. If you close the terminal or stop theclaudeprocess, the session ends. Runclaude remote-controlagain to start a new one.
* Extended network outage: if your machine is awake but unable to reach the network for more than roughly 10 minutes, the session times out and the process exits. Runclaude remote-controlagain to start a new session.
