# I Wrote a Scheme in 2025


by Matthew Plant

One year minus one week ago to the day Ipublished an articleannouncing the new Scheme implementation I was writing,scheme-rs.
Today I am excited to announce thatscheme-rshas reached its first version,0.1.0. You can check it out at it’s website (scheme-rs.org, which should be
updated toscheme.rsat some point when DNS propagation finishes) or itsgithub page.

Although there’s much more work to do (and I will talk about that further down
the page), after reaching the milestone of completing2258tests in the R6RS
test suite, I’ve decided thatscheme-rsis stable enough to commit to a first
release.

It’s been a pretty amazing journey, one that I’m excited to continue on.

## Changes since I initially announced scheme-rs last year:

There have been some changes since I initially announced scheme-rs. The biggest
is that it is no longer exclusively async, and now supports sync as well.

This change was inevitable; only supporting async would really hamper adoption
(or more importantly my personal use cases for the project). But I’m really
happy that I was able to implement this change without hamstringing async
support at all. In fact, it is even possible to use scheme-rs in both async and
sync contexts.

## Things that are not finished

There are quite a few things that are not quite complete, and I will list them
here:

* The garbage collector has quite a bit of room for improvement.
* Performance in general is Ok but could be made much better.
* There are a lot of missing procedures and syntax from R6RS but also just in
general, for example I’d really like to add pattern matching.
* There’s always more documentation that can be added.
* Debugging could be greatly improved.

But more importantly, I’m very excited to start working on the new language I am
building on top ofscheme-rs. I mentioned that it would be strongly typed, but
now I think I might want to use calculus of construction. The possibilities are
truly endless!

## An aside on how scheme-rs came to be:

In August of last year I had just lost my job. I wasn’t sure exactly what to do.
I looked out on the landscape of software engineering jobs and became
increasingly uncertain of my place in it. I had been unsatisfied with work for a
number of years at that point, and it felt like I had lost the differentiating
factor that made me worth hiring in the first place. The idea of getting a job
that was interesting, one that challenged me, seemed to be completely out of
reach.

I decided that what I would do is look inward. I would try to rediscover where
my original love for computer science came from. I had this dinky little project
that I had been working on and off on for a while with no clear vision. I
decided that I would spend my free time dedicated to that project. I would do
research and focus on doing things correctly and with a strong backing from
academics. I’d apply for a few jobs, but if those fell through I’d apply for
grad school instead.

I’d buy a printer and read papers.

That dinky little project wasscheme-rs, and it’s hard to describe just how
much it changed my life. I feel much more confident in my ability as a software
engineer. I no longer think that a PhD is something that is meant for people
much smarter than me. And more miraculously it directly lead me to finding a job
that I absolutely love.

scheme-rsis not particularly special in this regard. It was simply something
that challenged me. And if you have a brain at all like mine, I highly
recommend you find a project that challenges you likescheme-rschallenged me.

If you like being challenged and enjoy functional programming and Rust as much
as I do, check outthe careers page at OneChronos!
