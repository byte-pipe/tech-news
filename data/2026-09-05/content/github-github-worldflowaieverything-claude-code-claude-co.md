# Everything Claude Code

The complete collection of Claude Code configs from an Anthropic hackathon winner.

Production-ready agents, skills, hooks, commands, rules, and MCP configurations evolved over 10+ months of intensive daily use building real products.

## The Guides

This repo is the raw code only. The guides explain everything.

Shorthand Guide
Setup, foundations, philosophy. 
Read this first.

Longform Guide
Token optimization, memory persistence, evals, parallelization.

Topic

What You'll Learn

Token Optimization

Model selection, system prompt slimming, background processes

Memory Persistence

Hooks that save/load context across sessions automatically

Continuous Learning

Auto-extract patterns from sessions into reusable skills

Verification Loops

Checkpoint vs continuous evals, grader types, pass@k metrics

Parallelization

Git worktrees, cascade method, when to scale instances

Subagent Orchestration

The context problem, iterative retrieval pattern

## Cross-Platform Support

This plugin now fully supportsWindows, macOS, and Linux. All hooks and scripts have been rewritten in Node.js for maximum compatibility.

### Package Manager Detection

The plugin automatically detects your preferred package manager (npm, pnpm, yarn, or bun) with the following priority:

1. Environment variable:CLAUDE_PACKAGE_MANAGER
2. Project config:.claude/package-manager.json
3. package.json:packageManagerfield
4. Lock file: Detection from package-lock.json, yarn.lock, pnpm-lock.yaml, or bun.lockb
5. Global config:~/.claude/package-manager.json
6. Fallback: First available package manager

To set your preferred package manager:

#
 Via environment variable

export
 CLAUDE_PACKAGE_MANAGER=pnpm

#
 Via global config

node scripts/setup-package-manager.js --global pnpm

#
 Via project config

node scripts/setup-package-manager.js --project bun

#
 Detect current setting

node scripts/setup-package-manager.js --detect

Or use the/setup-pmcommand in Claude Code.

## Installation

### Option 1: Install as Plugin (Recommended)

The easiest way to use this repo - install as a Claude Code plugin:

#
 Add this repo as a marketplace

/plugin marketplace add affaan-m/everything-claude-code

#
 Install the plugin

/plugin install everything-claude-code@everything-claude-code

Or add directly to your~/.claude/settings.json:

{
 
"extraKnownMarketplaces"
: {
 
"everything-claude-code"
: {
 
"source"
: {
 
"source"
: 
"
github
"
,
 
"repo"
: 
"
affaan-m/everything-claude-code
"

 }
 }
 },
 
"enabledPlugins"
: {
 
"everything-claude-code@everything-claude-code"
: 
true

 }
}

This gives you instant access to all commands, agents, skills, and hooks.

#

Important:ReplaceYOUR_*_HEREplaceholders with your actual API keys.

## Key Concepts

### Agents

Subagents handle delegated tasks with limited scope. Example:

---

name
: 
code-reviewer

description
: 
Reviews code for quality, security, and maintainability

tools
: 
Read, Grep, Glob, Bash

model
: 
opus

---

You are a senior code reviewer...

### Skills

Skills are workflow definitions invoked by commands or agents:

# 
TDD Workflow

1
.
 Define interfaces first

2
.
 Write failing tests (RED)

3
.
 Implement minimal code (GREEN)

4
.
 Refactor (IMPROVE)

5
.
 Verify 80%+ coverage

### Hooks

Hooks fire on tool events. Example - warn about console.log:

{
 
"matcher"
: 
"
tool == 
\"
Edit
\"
 && tool_input.file_path matches 
\"\\\\
.(ts|tsx|js|jsx)$
\"
"
,
 
"hooks"
: [{
 
"type"
: 
"
command
"
,
 
"command"
: 
"
#!/bin/bash
\n
grep -n 'console
\\
.log' 
\"
$file_path
\"
 && echo '[Hook] Remove console.log' >&2
"

 }]
}

### Rules

Rules are always-follow guidelines. Keep them modular:

~/.claude/rules/
 security.md # No hardcoded secrets
 coding-style.md # Immutability, file limits
 testing.md # TDD, coverage requirements

## Running Tests

The plugin includes a comprehensive test suite:

#
 Run all tests

node tests/run-all.js

#
 Run individual test files

node tests/lib/utils.test.js
node tests/lib/package-manager.test.js
node tests/hooks/hooks.test.js

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome and encouraged.

This repo is meant to be a community resource. If you have:

* Useful agents or skills
* Clever hooks
* Better MCP configurations
* Improved rules

Please contribute! SeeCONTRIBUTING.mdfor guidelines.

### Ideas for Contributions

* Language-specific skills (Python, Go, Rust patterns)
* Framework-specific configs (Django, Rails, Laravel)
* DevOps agents (Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS)
* Testing strategies (different frameworks)
* Domain-specific knowledge (ML, data engineering, mobile)

## Background

I've been using Claude Code since the experimental rollout. Won the Anthropic x Forum Ventures hackathon in Sep 2025 buildingzenith.chatwith@DRodriguezFX- entirely using Claude Code.

These configs are battle-tested across multiple production applications.

## Important Notes

### Context Window Management

Critical:Don't enable all MCPs at once. Your 200k context window can shrink to 70k with too many tools enabled.

Rule of thumb:

* Have 20-30 MCPs configured
* Keep under 10 enabled per project
* Under 80 tools active

UsedisabledMcpServersin project config to disable unused ones.

### Customization

These configs work for my workflow. You should:

1. Start with what resonates
2. Modify for your stack
3. Remove what you don't use
4. Add your own patterns
