# Cog

A plain-text cognitive architecture for Claude Code — simple by design, so the model can reason over its own memory with the same Unix tools (grep,find,git diff) it already knows.

Documentation|Why Text|Credits & Inspiration

## What is Cog?

Cog is a set of conventions — not code — that teach Claude Code how to build and maintain its own memory. You define the rules in plain text. Claude scaffolds the structure and follows them. The filesystem is the interface.

There is no server, no runtime, no application code.CLAUDE.mdcontains the conventions — how to tier memory, when to condense, how to route queries, when to archive. The skill files (.claude/commands/*.md) teach Claude specific workflows: reflection, foresight, housekeeping, self-evolution. Claude reads these instructions and follows them to organize, maintain, and grow a persistent knowledge base across sessions.

Everything is plain textby design. Not as a compromise — because plain text is what makes this work. Memory files are just markdown, which means Claude cangrepfor patterns,findwhat changed,wcto check file sizes, andgit diffto see what the last pipeline run touched. The same Unix tools that make Linux powerful make Cog's memory observable and maintainable.

Cog is a learning tool — an experiment in watching how a memory architecture evolves when given clear conventions and self-observation capabilities. You set the rules, Claude scaffolds the structure, and the pipeline skills refine the conventions over time. The model doesn't evolve — it follows whatever rules it finds. The rules are what change. Every decision is visible. Every rule is editable. Every change is in the git log.

## Quick Start

RequiresClaude Code.

git clone https://github.com/marciopuga/cog

cd
 cog

Open the project in Claude Code, then:

/setup

Cog will ask about your life and work — company, side projects, what you want to track. From that conversation, it generates everything: domain manifest, memory directories, skill files, and routing table.

That's it. Start talking.

### Permissions

Cog ships with.claude/settings.jsonthat pre-approves the tools it needs — file reads, writes, edits, search, and git operations. When you first open the project, Claude Code will ask you to accept these project-level permissions. Say yes once and you won't be interrupted again.

If you'd rather review everything manually, delete.claude/settings.jsonand Claude Code will prompt for each operation individually.

## How It Works

CLAUDE.mddefines the conventions below. Claude reads them at the start of every session and follows them to decide where to store facts, when to condense, how to route queries, and when to archive. Thememory/directory is the state that emerges from following these rules over time.

### Three-Tier Memory

memory/
├── hot-memory.md ← Always loaded. <50 lines. What matters right now.
├── personal/ ← Warm. Loaded when relevant.
│ ├── hot-memory.md
│ ├── observations.md ← Append-only event log
│ ├── action-items.md ← Tasks with due dates
│ ├── entities.md ← People, places, things
│ └── ...
├── work/acme/ ← Your work domain (created by /setup)
│ └── ...
└── glacier/ ← Cold. Archived, indexed, retrieved on demand.
 └── index.md

* Hot: Loaded every conversation. Current state, top priorities.
* Warm: Domain-specific files loaded when a skill activates.
* Glacier: YAML-frontmattered archives. Searched viaglacier/index.md.

### What Memory Looks Like

Here's what builds up over time. None of this is pre-filled — it emerges from your conversations.

Heavy entries get promoted to thread files — the entity stub just links:→ [[work/acme/sarah-chen]].

### Progressive Condensation

Two processes:

Condensation:observations → patterns → hot-memory. Each layer is smaller and more actionable than the one below.

Archival:old observations → glacier. Indexed, retrievable, out of the way.

Nothing is deleted — it moves to the right place.

### Threads — The Zettelkasten Layer

When a topic keeps coming up across observations, Cog raises it into athread— a read-optimized synthesis file that pulls scattered fragments into a coherent narrative.

Every thread has the same spine:

* Current State— what's true right now (rewrite freely)
* Timeline— dated entries, append-only, full detail preserved
* Insights— patterns, learnings, what's different this time

A thread gets raised when a topic appears in 3+ observations across 2+ weeks, or when you say "raise X" or "thread X". Threads grow long — that's the point. The texture is the value. One file forever, never condensed.

Fragments (observations) never move. Threads reference them via wiki-links.

See the fullThread Framework documentationfor details.

### L0 / L1 / L2 Tiered Loading

Every memory file has a one-line summary:<!-- L0: what's in this file -->. This is the first tier of a three-level retrieval protocol:

* L0— one-line summary. Decides whether to open a file at all.
* L1— section header scan. Identifies which part of a long file to read.
* L2— full file read. Used when the full context is needed.

Scan L0s first, confirm relevance, use L1 for long files, read only what's needed.

### Single Source of Truth

Each fact lives in one canonical file.entities.mdowns people.action-items.mdowns tasks.hot-memory.mdholds pointers — not the authoritative version of any fact. Other files reference with[[wiki-links]]instead of copying.

### Wiki-Links

Files cross-reference each other with[[domain/filename]]links. A link index is auto-generated by/housekeepingso you can discover what connects to what.

### Domain Registry

Domains are areas of your life — personal, work, side projects. Each domain gets its own memory directory and slash command.

/setup → conversational → domains.yml → directories + skills + routing

## Pipeline

Cog includes pipeline skills that maintain memory health over time. Run them manually:

/housekeeping # Archive stale data, prune hot-memory, rebuild indexes
/reflect # Mine recent work, condense patterns, detect threads
/evolve # Audit architecture, check rule effectiveness
/foresight # Cross-domain scan, surface one strategic nudge

Or automate with scheduling:

Claude Codehas built-in task scheduling — use/loopor cron to run pipeline skills on a recurring basis:

#
 Example: nightly housekeeping + reflect via cron

cat .claude/commands/reflect.md
)
"

Coworksessions can also run pipeline skills. Open Cog in Cowork and ask it to run/housekeepingor/reflect— it has full file access and can maintain memory as part of a longer autonomous session.

The pipeline is optional. Cog works without it — but running it regularly keeps memory clean and surfaces insights you'd miss.

## Architecture

Cog's architecture lives entirely in instructions —CLAUDE.mdfor conventions and.claude/commands/*.mdfor workflows. There is no application code. The instructions define how memory is structured, how queries are routed, and how the system maintains itself. Claude reads these files and acts on them. Thememory/directory is just the state that accumulates.

This makes Cog interface-agnostic. It works with:

* Claude Code(terminal) — native. Just open the project.
* Cowork— Claude Desktop's agentic mode. Point it atmemory/and it inherits everything. Great for heavy document generation and long autonomous workflows.
* Any Claude-powered toolthat readsCLAUDE.mdand has file access.

The memory system is the same everywhere — markdown files with conventions. The interface just determines how context is loaded.

## Connecting Tools

Cog becomes significantly more powerful when connected to external tools via MCP (Model Context Protocol). In Claude Code or Cowork, you can connect services like:

* Google Calendar— schedule awareness, meeting prep, time-blocking
* Gmail— email drafting, inbox triage, follow-up tracking
* Slack— team context, message drafting, channel monitoring
* GitHub— PR reviews, issue tracking, codebase awareness
* Linear/Jira— project tracking, sprint context
* Notion/Obsidian— extended knowledge base, note sync

When tools are connected, Cog's skills can use them automatically./foresightchecks your calendar before surfacing nudges./reflectcan reference Slack threads./personalcan draft emails. The memory layer gives these tools something they don't have alone: context that persists and compounds.

To connect tools in Cowork, add MCP servers in your Cowork settings. Each tool appears as a set of functions Cog can call alongside its memory operations — no code changes needed.

The combination of persistent memory + connected tools is where Cog stops being a note-taking system and starts being a cognitive layer. Memory without action is a diary. Memory with tools is an agent.
