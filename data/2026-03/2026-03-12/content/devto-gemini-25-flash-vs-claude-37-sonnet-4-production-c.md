An evaluation of the Gemini 2.5 flash and Claude 3.7 Sonnet model for an agentic engine.

I had a simple rule when choosing an LLM forOzigi: don't pick based on benchmark leaderboards. After my v2 launch, in recieving feedback, a user suggested I use the Claude models as they were better for content generation than Gemini. While the suggestion sounded tempting, I had to pick a model based on the four constraints my production pipeline couldn't negotiate around.

Most "Gemini vs Claude" comparisons evaluate general-purpose capabilities like coding, reasoning, and creative writing. That's useful if you're building a general-purpose product.I wasn't.Ozigi is a content engine. You feed it a URL, a PDF, or raw notes. It returns a structured 3-day social media campaign as a JSON payload that the frontend maps directly into UI cards.

That specificity made the evaluation easier than I expected: Two models, Four constraints. One clear winner on three of the constraints.

This is the third post in theOzigi Changelog Series. If you want the backstory on why Ozigi exists, start withhow I vibe-coded the internal toolthat became it, and thev2 changelogthat introduced the modular architecture this decision was built on.

Here's the full Architecture Decision Record.

## The Setup: What the Pipeline Actually Does

The core API route in Ozigi does this:

1. Accepts amultipart/form-datapayload containing a URL, raw text, and/or a file (PDF or image)
2. Constructs a prompt with strict editorial constraints injected at the system level
3. Sends everything to the LLM via theVertex AI Node.js SDK
4. Returns the raw text response directly to the client

The frontend then does this:

const

parsed

=

JSON
.
parse
(
responseText
);

setCampaign
(
parsed
.
campaign
);

Enter fullscreen mode

Exit fullscreen mode

No middleware. No schema validation. No error recovery in the happy path. Raw parse, straight into React state.

That single line is why model selection mattered.

## Constraint 1: Comparing Gemini vs Claude Models for JSON Output Stability

The requirement:The model must return a valid JSON object — every time, without wrapping it in markdown code fences, without adding a conversational preamble, and without hallucinating a trailing comma that breaksJSON.parse().

The target schema looks like this:

{


"campaign"
:

[


{

"day"
:

1
,

"x"
:

"..."
,

"linkedin"
:

"..."
,

"discord"
:

"..."

},


{

"day"
:

2
,

"x"
:

"..."
,

"linkedin"
:

"..."
,

"discord"
:

"..."

},


{

"day"
:

3
,

"x"
:

"..."
,

"linkedin"
:

"..."
,

"discord"
:

"..."

}


]

}

Enter fullscreen mode

Exit fullscreen mode

It renders nine posts across three platforms in a span of three days, with every field required.The UI renders each field into a separate card with edit, copy, and publish actions. A missing key doesn't throw a visible error — it silently renders an empty card.This comparison is specifically between Gemini withresponseSchemaenforcement and Claude with prompted JSON, not between each model's structural output ceiling. Claude's tool use withtool_choice: {type: "tool"}enforces schema at the decoding layer and can reach equivalent reliability. The relevant constraint here was which enforcement mechanism was available and practical within my existing stack. More on that below.I ran 500 automated test generations against both models targeting this schema, measuring the percentage of responses thatJSON.parse()accepted without exceptions.

Model

Format Adherence Rate

Gemini 2.5 Flash

99.9%

Claude 3.7 Sonnet (prompted)

~88.5%

The 11.5% gap maps directly to broken UI states for real users. That was not acceptable to me for a core feature.

Using Gemini'sresponseSchemacloses this entirely. According toGoogle's controlled generation documentation, the feature physically prevents the model from returning output that doesn't conform to your schema. It's not prompt-level guidance, it's enforced at the decoding layer. Here's what the production implementation looks like for Ozigi: the schema is defined once at the top of the route and attached directly to the model config:

const

};

},

});

Enter fullscreen mode

Exit fullscreen mode

response.text()is now structurally guaranteed to be valid JSON.JSON.parse()cannot fail on a missing field, trailing comma, or conversational preamble — the model is physically prevented from producing them.Claude's tool use and function calling can achieve similar guarantees, but it requires a meaningfully different integration architecture. With the Vertex SDK, this is one config block.

Winner: Gemini.

## Constraint 2: Comparing Gemini vs Claude on Latency on a Live Public Sandbox

The requirement:Ozigi has a free, unauthenticated sandbox. Anyone can generate a full 3-day campaign without signing up.

That changes the economics of model selection completely. A paying user on a premium plan will tolerate a 20-second wait if the output quality justifies it. An anonymous user who found the product via my whacky marketing efforts will not. They'll close the tab at 10 seconds and probably not come back, sadly.

I benchmarked both models against a standard 10,000-token input payload via Vercel serverless functions (my production environment):

Model

Avg Response Time

Gemini 2.5 Flash

~6.2s

Claude 3.7 Sonnet

~21.5s

Methodology: N=100 requests per model, measured end-to-end from Vercel function invocation to full response. Results are environment-dependent and intended for directional comparison, not as absolute benchmarks.

The gap holds across payload sizes. Gemini Flash consistently comes in under 10-15 seconds. Claude 3.7 Sonnet consistently exceeds 20 seconds on the same inputs, in the same environment.

This gap would narrow significantly with streaming: getting first tokens in front of the user within 2-3 seconds. Streaming changes the perceived wait time for a user entirely. This is, however, a v4 architecture item that is being worked on. For a non-streaming pipeline with a public sandbox, the 3.5x latency difference is a product decision, not just an engineering one.

Winner: Gemini Flash— and it's not close for non-streaming public sandboxes.

## Constraint 3: Comparing Gemini vs Claude on Native Multimodal Ingestion

The requirement:Users can upload PDFs and images directly as context. The pipeline needs to process them without an external preprocessing step.

With Gemini via theVertex AI Node.js SDK, the entire PDF pipeline is:

// /app/api/generate/route.ts

if
(
file

&&

file
.
size

>

0
)

{


const

arrayBuffer

=

await

file
.
arrayBuffer
();


const

base64Data

=

Buffer
.
from
(
arrayBuffer
).
toString
(
"
base64
"
);


parts
.
push
({


inlineData
:

{


data
:

base64Data
,


mimeType
:

file
.
type
,

// "application/pdf", "image/jpeg", etc.


},


});

}

const

result

=

await

model
.
generateContent
({


contents
:

[{

role
:

"
user
"
,

parts
:

parts

}],

});

Enter fullscreen mode

Exit fullscreen mode

You can see that the SDK handles the buffer natively. Gemini reads the PDF directly as part of the multipart request alongside the text prompt — no OCR step, no preprocessing, no separate service call.Google's multimodal documentationconfirms that Gemini was designed from the ground up to handle PDF and image buffers natively viainlineData.

An earlier version of this article claimed that Claude required an external OCR step for PDF ingestion. That was wrong. Claude's Messages API does support native base64 PDF ingestion directly via a document content block — no OCR preprocessing, no external service. The pattern is structurally similar to Vertex AI's inlineData, just different field names.The real constraint here was ecosystem, not capability. I evaluated Claude 3.7 Sonnet as available in the Google Model Garden within my existing Vertex AI setup. Switching to Claude's native PDF ingestion would have meant moving to the Anthropic Messages API entirely — a different provider, different SDK, different billing. The Vertex AI path was simpler for the stack I was already running.Winner: Gemini — for this stack. Both models support native multimodal ingestion without external OCR. The advantage here was ecosystem fit, not a fundamental capability difference.

## Constraint 4: Comparing Google Gemini vs Claude on Tone Engineering

The requirement:Generated social media posts must sound like a human wrote them. Specifically, they must pass AI content detection and avoid the predictable cadence patterns that make AI-generated copy immediately identifiable.

This is the constraint where Claude wins cleanly on base performance.Our internal blind A/B evaluations of 50 technical posts (scored on pragmatic sentence structure and absence of AI terminology) gave Claude 3.7 Sonnet a "human cadence quality score" of 9.5/10. Gemini Flash's base score was 5.5/10.

That's a significant gap. And it's for the feature that is Ozigi's core value proposition.

### Why use Gemini for Tone Engineering?

Because the gap is engineerable.

We built the Banned Lexicon — a programmatic constraint injected at the system prompt level that explicitly penalizes the vocabulary patterns that make AI copy detectable. You can read the full implementation in theOzigi documentation:

THE BANNED LEXICON: You are strictly forbidden from using the
following words or their variations: delve, testament, tapestry,
crucial, vital, landscape, realm, unlock, supercharge, revolutionize,
paradigm, seamlessly, navigate, robust, cutting-edge, game-changer.

Enter fullscreen mode

Exit fullscreen mode

Combined with explicit cadence engineering:

BURSTINESS (CADENCE): Write with high burstiness. Do not use
perfectly balanced, medium-length sentences. Mix extremely short,
punchy sentences (2-4 words) with longer, detailed explanations.

PERPLEXITY: Avoid predictable adjectives. Use strong, active verbs
and concrete nouns. Talk like a pragmatic subject matter expert
explaining a concept to people, not a marketer selling a product.

FORMATTING RESTRAINT: You are limited to a MAXIMUM of 1 emoji per
post. Use a maximum of 2 highly relevant hashtags per post.

Enter fullscreen mode

Exit fullscreen mode

With these constraints active, Gemini's human cadence score jumps from 5.5 to 9.2 — within acceptable range of Claude's base 9.5.

The key insight: Claude's tone advantage is adefaultadvantage, not anabsoluteone. Gemini's outputs are more malleable under prompt constraints. For a use case where tone control is the entire product, that malleability is worth more than a higher baseline.

Winner: Gemini + engineering constraints.The tone gap is closeable. The latency and JSON stability gaps on the other constraints are not.

## Gemini vs Claude Models: The Cost Reality

At this stage where Ozigi is a public sandbox, every anonymous page load that can trigger a generation is a billable API call absorbed by the product. Ozigi is at its pre-revenue stage, so this matters a lot.

Model

Input Cost (per 1M tokens)

Output Cost (per 1M tokens)

Gemini 2.5 Flash

~$0.075

~$0.30

Claude 3.7 Sonnet

~$3.00

~$15.00

Pricing sourced fromGoogle Cloud Vertex AI pricingandAnthropic API pricing.

Pro tip:Verify current rates before production decisions — both have changed multiple times in the past year.

The input cost difference is 40x. The output cost difference is 50x. For a free-tier product with no revenue, the ability to run a public sandbox sustainably is the difference between having a conversion funnel and not having one.

## Where Ozigi is Going and How it'd Change My Choice of Model, Moving Foward

This is an honestADR. Here's what would change my answer.

When Ozigi finally moves behind a paywall, latency and cost become secondary concerns. A signed-in user on a paid plan is more likely waiting 20 seconds for premium output is a different UX calculation than an anonymous user on a free demo. In that context, Claude's base tone quality becomes much more compelling. I'd be trading economics for output baseline, and the trade might be worth it.

When streaming gets implemented, the latency argument against Claude weakens significantly. Claude 3.7 Sonnet's time-to-first-token via streaming is competitive. A user seeing the first post appear in 2-3 seconds experiences the product very differently than a user staring at a progress bar for 21 seconds. Streaming is on the roadmap.

For an in-depth look at how we tested the pipeline that informs these decisions, seehow we E2E test AI agents with Playwright in Next.js.

Gemini won on five of six dimensions. Claude won on one — base tone — and that gap was closeable through prompt engineering.

## Four Questions To Ask Before Choosing An LLM Model For Your Agentic Project/APP

If you're building something similar to Ozigi, these are the constraints worth looking through before you pick an API and start building:

**1. Does your UI depend on structured output? If your frontend callsJSON.parse()on a raw model response, you need API-level schema enforcement — not prompt instructions asking nicely.responseSchemavia Vertex AI, Claude's tool use with forcedtool_choice, orstructured outputs via OpenAIall enforce at the decoding layer. The question isn't which model supports it — most do — it's which enforcement path fits your existing stack.

2. Do you have a free tier or public sandbox?If yes, latency and cost are product decisions that affect conversion, not just infrastructure decisions that affect margins.

**3. Does your use case require multimodal inputs? Most major models now support native PDF and image ingestion without external preprocessing. Map out what the integration looks like within your existing API provider before assuming you need to switch or add infrastructure

4. Where is the base model weakest, and is that gap engineerable?Claude's tone advantage is real. It's also not the only path to human-sounding copy. Engineering constraints at the prompt level can close gaps that feel insurmountable when you're just looking at base benchmarks.

The best model for your product is rarely the one with the highest aggregate score. It's the one that fails least on the constraints you actually can't work around.
