## What is Agents?

The Agent Framework is designed for building realtime, programmable participants
that run on servers. Use it to create conversational, multi-modal voice
agents that can see, hear, and understand.

## Features

* Flexible integrations: A comprehensive ecosystem to mix and match the right STT, LLM, TTS, and Realtime API to suit your use case.
* Integrated job scheduling: Built-in task scheduling and distribution withdispatch APIsto connect end users to agents.
* Extensive WebRTC clients: Build client applications using LiveKit's open-source SDK ecosystem, supporting all major platforms.
* Telephony integration: Works seamlessly with LiveKit'stelephony stack, allowing your agent to make calls to or receive calls from phones.
* Exchange data with clients: UseRPCsand otherData APIsto seamlessly exchange data with clients.
* Semantic turn detection: Uses a transformer model to detect when a user is done with their turn, helps to reduce interruptions.
* MCP support: Native support for MCP. Integrate tools provided by MCP servers with one line of code.
* Builtin test framework: Write tests and use judges to ensure your agent is performing as expected.
* Open-source: Fully open-source, allowing you to run the entire stack on your own servers, includingLiveKit server, one of the most widely used WebRTC media servers.

## Installation

To install the core Agents library, along with plugins for popular model providers:

pip install 
"
livekit-agents[openai,deepgram,cartesia]
"

## Docs and guides

Documentation on the framework and how to use it can be foundhere

### Building with AI coding agents

If you're using an AI coding assistant to build with LiveKit Agents, we recommend the following setup for the best results:

1. Install theLiveKit Docs MCP server— Gives your coding agent access to up-to-date LiveKit documentation, code search across LiveKit repositories, and working examples.
2. Install theLiveKit Agent Skill— Provides your coding agent with architectural guidance and best practices for building voice AI applications, including workflow design, handoffs, tasks, and testing patterns.npx skills add livekit/agent-skills --skill livekit-agents

The Agent Skill works best alongside the MCP server: the skill teaches your agenthow to approachbuilding with LiveKit, while the MCP server provides thecurrent API detailsto implement it correctly.

## Core concepts

* Agent: An LLM-based application with defined instructions.
* AgentSession: A container for agents that manages interactions with end users.
* entrypoint: The starting point for an interactive session, similar to a request handler in a web server.
* AgentServer: The main process that coordinates job scheduling and launches agents for user sessions.

# stt=deepgram.STT(model="nova-3"),

 
# llm=openai.LLM(model="gpt-4.1-mini"),

## Running your agent

### Testing in terminal

python myagent.py console

Runs your agent in terminal mode, enabling local audio input and output for testing.
This mode doesn't require external servers or dependencies and is useful for quickly validating behavior.

### Developing with LiveKit clients

python myagent.py dev

Starts the agent server and enables hot reloading when files change. This mode allows each process to host multiple concurrent agents efficiently.

The agent connects to LiveKit Cloud or your self-hosted server. Set the following environment variables:

* LIVEKIT_URL
* LIVEKIT_API_KEY
* LIVEKIT_API_SECRET

You can connect using any LiveKit client SDK or telephony integration.
To get started quickly, try theAgents Playground.

### Running for production

python myagent.py start

Runs the agent with production-ready optimizations.

## License

The Agents framework is licensed underApache-2.0. The LiveKit turn detection models are licensed under theLiveKit Model License.

## Contributing

The Agents framework is under active development in a rapidly evolving field. We welcome and appreciate contributions of any kind, be it feedback, bugfixes, features, new plugins and tools, or better documentation. You can file issues under this repo, open a PR, or chat with us in theLiveKit community.

### Development setup

This project usesuvfor package management. To install dependencies for development:

uv sync --all-extras --dev

### Examples

This project includes many examples in theexamplesdirectory. To run them, create the fileexamples/.envwith credentials for LiveKit Server and any necessary model providers (seeexamples/.env.example), then run:

uv run examples/voice_agents/basic_agent.py dev

For more information, see theexamples README.

### Tests

Unit tests are in thetestsdirectory and can be run with:

uv run pytest --unit

Integration tests for each plugin require various API credentials and run automatically in GitHub CI for PRs submitted by project maintainers. See thetests workflowfor details.

### Formatting

This project usesrufffor formatting and linting:

uv run ruff format
uv run ruff check --fix

### Documentation

To generate docs locally withpdoc:
