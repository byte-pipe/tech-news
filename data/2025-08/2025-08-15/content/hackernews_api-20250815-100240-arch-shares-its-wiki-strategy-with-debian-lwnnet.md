# Arch shares its wiki strategy with Debian

## [LWN subscriber-only content]

DebConf

TheArch Linux projectis
especially well-known in the Linux community for two things: its
rolling-release model and the quality of the documentation in theArchWiki. No
matter which Linux distribution one uses, the odds are that eventually
the ArchWiki's documentation will prove useful. The Debian project
recognized this and has sought to improve its own documentation game
by inviting ArchWiki maintainers Jakub Klinkovský and Vladimir
Lavallade toDebConf25in
Brest, France, to speak about how Arch manages its wiki. The talk has
already borne fruit with the launch of an effort to revamp the Debian
wiki.

Klinkovský and Lavallade were introduced by Debian developer Thomas
Lange, who said that he had the idea to invite the pair to
DebConf. Klinkovský said that he had been a maintainer of the wiki
since about 2014, and that he is also a package maintainer for Arch
Linux. He added that he contributes to many other projects
"wherever I can". For his part, Lavallade said that he has
contributed to the wiki since 2021, but he had only recently joined
the maintenance team: "I know just enough to be dangerous."

Lavallade said that the talk was a good opportunity to
cross-pollinate with another distribution, and to do some
self-reflection on how the wiki team operates. They would explain how
the wiki is run using theSWOT analysisformat, with a focus on the content and how the maintenance team keeps
the quality of pages as high as it can. "SWOT", for those who have
been fortunate enough not to have encountered the acronym through
corporate meetings, is short for "strengths, weaknesses,
opportunities, and threats". SWOT analysis is generally used for
decision-making processes to help analyze the current state
and identify what an organization needs to improve.

#### ArchWiki:About

The ArchWiki was established in 2004; the project originally usedPhpWikias its
backend—but Klinkovský said that it was quickly migrated to
MediaWiki, which is still in use today. The wikimaintenanceandtranslationteams were established "about 2010". The maintenance team is
responsible for thecontribution
guidelines,style
conventions, organization, and anything else that contributors need
to know.

Today, the wiki has more than 4,000 topic pages; it has close to
30,000 pages if one countstalk
pages,redirects,
andhelp
pages. "We are still quite a small wiki compared to
Wikipedia", Klinkovský said.

He displayed a slide, part of which is shown below, with graphs
showing the number of edits and active users per month. Thefull set of
slidesis available online as well.

Since 2006, the wiki has had more than 840,000 edits by more than
86,000 editors; the project is averaging more than 2,000 edits by
about 300 active contributors each month. Klinkovský noted that this
"used to be quite a larger number".

#### Strengths

Lavallade had a short list of the "best user-facing qualities"
of the ArchWiki, which are the project's strengths. The first was
"comprehensive content and a very large coverage of various
topics". He said this included not just how to run Arch Linux, but
how to run important software on the distribution.

The next was having high-quality and up-to-date content. Given that
Arch is a rolling-release distribution, he said, every page has to be
updated to reflect the latest package provided with the
distribution. That is only possible thanks to "a very involved
community"; he noted that most of the edits on the ArchWiki were
made by contributors outside the maintenance team.

All of that brought him to the last strength he wanted to discuss:
its reach beyond the Arch community. He pulled up a slide that included a
quote from Edward Snowden, which said:

Is it just me, or have search results become absolute garbage for
basically every site? It's nearly impossible to discover useful
information these days (outside the ArchWiki).

#### Contribution and content guidelines

The contribution guidelines and processes have a lot to do with thequality of the content on the wiki. Contributors, he said, have to
follow three fundamental rules. The first is that they must use the
edit summary to explain what has been done and why. The second rule
is that contributors should not make complex edits all at once. As
much as possible, Lavallade said, contributors should do "some kind
of atomic editing" where each change is independent of the other
ones. He did not go into specifics on this during the talk, but theguidelineshave examples of best practices. The third rule is that major changes
or rewrites should be announced on a topic's talk page to give others
who are watching the topic a chance to weigh in.

The team also has three major content guidelines that Lavallade
highlighted. One that is likely familiar to anyone contributing to
technical documentation is thedon't
repeat yourself(DRY) principle. A topic should only exist in one
place, rather than being repeated on multiple pages. He also said that
the ArchWiki employed a "simple, but not stupid" approach to
the documentation. This means that the documentation should be simple
to read and maintain, but not offer too much hand-holding. Users also
need to be willing to learn; they may need to read through more
than one page to find the information they need to do something.

The final guideline is that everything is Arch-centric. Content on
the site may be useful for users running different Linux
distributions, and contributions are welcome that may apply to other
distributions, but "something that will not work on Arch as-is is
not something we will be hosting on our site". That, he said,
allowed the maintenance team to be focused on the content Arch
provides and helps to keep maintenance more manageable.

#### Maintenance

Speaking of maintenance, Klinkovský said, the project has tools andtemplatesto help make life easier for contributors. A reviewer might apply anaccuracytemplate, for instance, which will add it to apagethat lists all content that has been flagged as possibly
inaccurate. The templates are usually used and acted on by people,
but the project also has bots that can add some templates (such asdead
link) and even fix some problems.

The review process is an important part of maintenance, he
said. Everyone can participate in review, not just the maintainers of
the wiki. He explained that it was not possible for the maintenance
team to review everything, so much of the review is done by
people interested in specific topics who watch pages to see when
changes were made. If people spot errors, they are empowered to
fix them on their own, or to use the templates to flag them for others
to address. Maintainers are there, he said, "to make some authoritative
decisions when needed, and mediate disputes if they came up".

Klinkovský referred to watching and reviewing content on the wiki
as "patrolling",
and said there were some basic rules that should be followed, starting
with "assume good faith". Most people do something because they
think it is right; the maintainers rarely see outright vandalism on
the wiki.

The second rule, he said, is "when in doubt, discuss
changes with others before making a hasty decision". If a change
must be reverted, then a reviewer should always explainwhyit was reverted. This gives the original contributor a chance to come
back and fix the problem or address it in a different way. Lastly,
Klinkovský said, they wanted to avoidedit wars: "the
worst thing that can happen on a wiki is a few people just reverting
their changes after each other".

Preventing edit wars and encouraging contributions was, Lavallade
said, part of the broader topic of community management. The team
tries to encourage contributors to not only make one change, but to
learn the guidelines and keep contributing—and then help teach
others the guidelines.

Arch has support forums, such as IRC, and when people ask for help
there they are pointed to the wiki "because there is always the
solution on the ArchWiki". In the rare event that the wiki does
not have the solution, he said, "we gently point them to where the page
with the content needs to be" and invite the user to add it even
if it's not perfect the first time. That helps to reinforce the idea
that the wiki is a collaborative work that everyone should feel
welcome to add to.

#### Weaknesses

Lavallade said that the contribution model also illustrated one of
ArchWiki's weaknesses: there is a lot to learn about contributing to
the wiki, and newcomers can get tripped up. For example, he said that
the DRY principle was difficult for new contributors. Or a newcomer might
add a large chunk of content into a page that should be broken up into
several pages.

The MediaWiki markup language is another hurdle for new
contributors. He called the markup "antiquated", and
acknowledged that the style conventions for the ArchWiki are not
obvious either. It can take a lot of reading, cross-referencing, and
back-and-forth discussions for a new contributor to make a content
contribution correctly.

MediaWiki has a lot of strengths, Klinkovský said; it is
battle-proven software, it is the de facto standard platform for
wikis, and it has a nice API that can be used for integration with
external applications such as bots. But MediaWiki is a weakness as well, he
said. The platform is primarily developed for Wikipedia, and
its developers are from Wikipedia. "Sometimes their decisions don't
suit us", he said, and there was little way to make things exactly
as the ArchWiki maintenance team might want.

The primary weakness, though, was that its markup language is
"very weird and hard to understand both for humans and
machines". In 2025, most people know and write Markdown daily, but
MediaWiki markup is different. It is weird and fragile; changing a
single token can completely break a page. It is also, he said,
difficult to write a proper or robust parser for the language. This is
particularly true because there is no formal specification of the
language, just the reference implementation in the form of
MediaWiki. That can change at any time: "so even if you had a perfect
parser one day, it might not work the same or perfectly the next
day".

Since ArchWiki is developed by volunteer contributors, its content
is essentially driven by popularity; people generally only edit the
content that they have an interest in. Klinkovský said that this was
not a weakness, necessarily, but it was related to some
weaknesses. For example, some pages were edited frequently while
others were not touched for years due to lack of interest. To a
reader, it is not obvious whether page content is stale or recently
updated.

There is also no perfect way to ensure that content makes its way
to the wiki. He noted that people might solve their problem in a
discussion on Arch's forums, but that the solution might never end up
on the wiki.

#### Opportunities and threats

Klinkovský said that they had also identified several areas of
opportunity—such as community involvement and support tools for
editors—where the ArchWiki's work could be improved.

Lavallade said that one example of community involvement would be
to work with derivatives from Arch Linux, such asSteamOSor
Arch ports to CPU architectures other than x86-64. Currently, Arch is only
supported on x86-64, he noted, but the project has passed anRFCto
expand the number of architectures that would be supported.

Right now, the project has two tools for editors to use to make
their work a bit easier:wiki-scriptsandWiki
Monkey. Klinkovský explained that wiki-scripts was a collection of
Python scripts used to automate common actions, such as checking if
links actually work. Wiki Monkey is an interactive JavaScript tool
that runs in the web browser, he said, and can help contributors
improve content. For example, it haspluginsto expand contractions, fix headers, convert HTML<code>tags into proper MediaWiki markup, and more.

There is much more that could be added or improved, he said, like
linting software for grammar issues. The team might also consider
incorporating machine learning or AI techniques into the editor
workflow, "but this needs to be done carefully so we don't cause
more trouble than we have right now". The trouble the team has
with AI right now will probably sound familiar to anyone running an
open-source project today; specifically, AI-generated content that is
not up to par and scraper bots.

People have already tried contributing to ArchWiki using AI, but
Klinkovský pointed out that "current models are obviously not
trained on our style guidelines, because the content does not
fit". Using AI for problem solving also prevents people from fully
understanding a solution or how things work. That may be a problem for
the whole of society, he said, not just ArchWiki.

The scraper bot problem is a more immediate concern, in that the
project had to put the wiki behindAnubisin the early part
of the year for about two months. Currently they do not need to use
it, Klinkovský said, but they have it on standby if the bots come
back. "So this is still a threat and we cannot consider it
solved."

Another, non-technical, threat that the project faces is
burnout. Lavallade said that contributor burnout is a real problem,
and that people who have stayed a long while "usually start with a
good, strong string of changes, but they end up tapering their amount
of contributions". Everyone, he said, ends up running out of steam
at some point. Because of that, there is a need to keep bringing in
new contributors to replace people who have moved on.

#### Questions

One member of the audience wanted to know if there was a dedicated
chat room for the wiki to discuss changes coming in. Lavallade said
that there is an#archlinux-wikiroom onLibera.Chat, and anyone is welcome
there. However, the team frequently redirects conversations about
changes to the talk pages on the wiki to ensure that everyone
interested in a topic can discuss the change.

Steve McIntyre had two questions. He was curious about how many
maintainers the ArchWiki had and what kind of hardware or setup was
on the backend of the wiki "is this like, one virtual machine, or a
cluster?" Klinkovský said that there were about 30 to 50
maintainers at the moment. As far as the setup, he said he was not on
Arch's DevOps team and didn't know all the details, but he did know it
was just one virtual machine "in the cloud".

Like what you are reading?Try LWN for freefor 1 month,
 		no credit card required.Another person wanted to know if the team would choose MediaWiki
again if they were building the wiki today. Klinkovský did not quite
answer directly, but he said that if a project does not like the
markup language used by MediaWiki then it should look to a solution
that uses Markdown. But, if a project needs all of the other features
MediaWiki has, "like plugins or the API for writing bots and so
on", then MediaWiki is the best from all of the wiki software
available.One audience member pointed out that the chart seemed to show a
spike in activity beginning with COVID and a steady decline
since. They asked if the team had noticed that, and what they were
doing about it. Klinkovský said that they had not looked at that
problem as a whole team, or discussed what they could do about it. He
said that if Arch added new architectures or accepted contributions
from Arch-derivative distributions, it might reverse the trend.Lange closed the session by saying that he thought it was funny
that the presenters had said they wanted ArchWiki to be Arch-centric:
"I think you failed, because a lot of other people are reading your
really great, big wiki".#### Debian embraces MediaWikiThe session seems to have been a success in that it has helped to
inspire the Debian project torevampits
own wiki. Immediately after the ArchWiki presentation, there was aDebian
wiki BoFwhere it was decided to use MediaWiki. Debian currently
uses theMoinMoin1.9 branch, which
depends on Python 2.7.Since DebConf25, members of the wiki team have worked with the
Debian's system administrators team to put upwiki2025.debian.orgto eventually replace the current wiki. They have also created a newdebian-wikimailing list and decided to change the content licensing policy for
material contributed to the wiki. Changes submitted to the wiki after
July 24are now
licensedunder theCreative
Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 licenseunless otherwise
noted.If Debian can sustain the activity that has gone into the wiki
revamp since DebConf25, its wiki might give the ArchWiki project
a run for its money. In that case, given that ArchWiki has proven such
a good resource for Linux users regardless of distribution, everybody
will win.[Thanks to the Linux Foundation, LWN's travel sponsor, for funding

### Thank you Arch Linux documentation teamPosted Aug 12, 2025 18:50 UTC (Tue)
 bysmoogen(subscriber, #97)
 [Link]I want to say that if I need to find how a newer piece of software works, the Arch Linux wiki has always been the place for me to go to over the last .. 20 years? The documentation has always been top notch, kept up to date and filled with a technical knowledge rare in many places. I always wanted to know how this was possible when so many other documentation teams have struggled to keep up with the rapid changes in FLOSS ecosystems.This article gave me a lot of ideas on how this was possible and how they promoted a community to keep it going for so long. Thank you again everyone who has written documents for Arch.. they have been helpful to everyone.### Cooperation is keenPosted Aug 13, 2025 13:49 UTC (Wed)

 [Link] (1 responses)It's nice to see cooperation develop between community distributions. While it's understandable that people love to 'pick their favorite team', there's really little reason to act as if there is some kind of benefit to a strict rivalry.I do see that there's at least one somewhat actively developed Markdown extension for MediaWiki:https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:WikiMarkdown. Sure, having to use an extension is going to increase the oops factor over something natively supporting Markdown, but perhaps that could help the project lessen the barriers created by MediaWiki syntax and parsing? Cheers!### Cooperation is keenPosted Aug 14, 2025 16:43 UTC (Thu)

 [Link]A bunch of Markdown extensions do exist, but they just don’t seem to capture the extent of features you need to really feel like a wiki page. Markdown is narrow in the scope of syntax it wants to work with - if you want an image to be right-floated, you’re using HTML for that. That’s a downgrade from MediaWiki image syntax.I run a large MW myself, and earlier this year helped someone to set up a new wiki. They wrote the first article in Markdown, thousands of words, then went to paste it onto their new wiki, where they quickly learned MediaWiki isn’t Markdown. They then went down the path of trying Markdown extensions, then tried converting to wikitext with pandoc, then finally decided to just convert by hand.Unfortunately some extensions like VisualEditor are also very tied to the wikitext parser, and can’t be adapted to handle Markdown easily. The situation with syntax just isn’t great, but I guess Wikimedia is more concerned with maintaining the millions of articles that already exist in their wikis.### Wiki markup isn't too badPosted Aug 13, 2025 22:58 UTC (Wed)

 [Link] (3 responses)It's different from Markdown, but the description of wiki markup seems a bit overly negative. I've never tried writing a parser for it, but I would not describe it as "very weird and hard to understand ... for humans." Like any markup language, it must be learned, but it doesn't seem to be any harder than Markdown for comparable features.The fact that it's less familiar than Markdown is certainly a valid consideration, as it's quite reasonable to prefer a system that will be more familiar to its users, but the quotes suggest that it's inherently hard to use, which doesn't seem to be the case.Are there any specific examples of "changing a single token ... completely break[ing] a page"? I've never seen that happen on either of the MediaWiki sites I've been an active user of (one as an administrator), so I'm curious to see a case where it did happen.### Wiki markup isn't too badPosted Aug 13, 2025 23:43 UTC (Wed)

 [Link] (1 responses)I like wikitext, but on enwiki it's fairly common to see new users accidentally destroying the infobox, or adorning the page with a snazzy bright red error message after mangling its references.Then there's the very elaborate template system. At this point the comparison to Markdown stops – it's easy to have lighter syntax if you simply don't have the feature, but you can't really avoid running into MediaWiki templates even as a casual user. Templates are used in almost all MediaWiki installs I've seen, they're really great to automate repetitive elements in a page, but on some Wikis they're sprinkled in practically every paragraph of text.And a small mistake with these can have a very large blast radius. It's surprisingly easy to accidentally break tens of thousand of pages at once and/or to bring the servers to their knees with reasonable-looking changes.Wikimedia spent a lot of effort on the visual editor, and I think casual users really benefit from it. It's significantly harder to edit the average enwiki article in source form than a Markdown page.Take today's enwiki featured article for example, the page starts with a screenfull of templates for the infobox, it is sprinkled with inline <ref>{{cite ... }}</ref> calls that interrupt the flow of text with anywhere between a single line and half a screen of inline cite data, and even simple formatting uses '''''some unusual''''' syntax, like these 5 single quotes that control bold and italics.### Wiki markup isn't too badPosted Aug 14, 2025 12:04 UTC (Thu)

 [Link]It's fine as markup. I have a love/hate relationship with using the really exotic bits. You can do some crazy stuff with it (like, ahem,https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Wikitcms). But it sure is fun getting the kinks out, and remembering how it all works when you come back to it a year later.Significant whitespace! Oy.### Wiki markup isn't too badPosted Aug 14, 2025 12:23 UTC (Thu)

 [Link]> It's different from Markdown, but the description of wiki markup seems a bit overly negative.It's very complex and internally inconsistent, having grown through ad-hoc changes to the parsing logic over the years.When I researched wikitext parsers a few years ago, the only comprehensive and robust one was Parsoid.It has been developed by the Wikimedia foundation since 2012 and ships with newer MediaWiki installations out of the box. It can convert between wikitext and annotated HTML which is then very easy to handle with any HTML library.As an example for the complexity of wikitext, Parsoid needs multiple parsing phases. Around five if I recall correctly.https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Parsoid### RecordingPosted Aug 14, 2025 7:59 UTC (Thu)
