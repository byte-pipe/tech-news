## Repository files navigation

hey is a tiny program that sends some load to a web application.

hey was originally called boom and was influenced from Tarek Ziade's
tool attarekziade/boom. Using the same name was a mistake as it resulted in cases
where binary name conflicts created confusion.
To preserve the name for its original owner, we renamed this project to hey.

## Installation

* Linux (amd64):https://storage.googleapis.com/hey-releases/hey_linux_amd64
* macOS (amd64):https://storage.googleapis.com/hey-releases/hey_darwin_amd64
* Windows (amd64):https://storage.googleapis.com/hey-releases/hey_windows_amd64

### Package Managers

macOS:

* Homebrewusers can usebrew install hey.

## Usage

hey runs provided number of requests in the provided concurrency level and prints stats.

It also supports HTTP2 endpoints.

Usage: hey [options...] <url>

Options:
 -n Number of requests to run. Default is 200.
 -c Number of workers to run concurrently. Total number of requests cannot
 be smaller than the concurrency level. Default is 50.
 -q Rate limit, in queries per second (QPS) per worker. Default is no rate limit.
 -z Duration of application to send requests. When duration is reached,
 application stops and exits. If duration is specified, n is ignored.
 Examples: -z 10s -z 3m.
 -o Output type. If none provided, a summary is printed.
 "csv" is the only supported alternative. Dumps the response
 metrics in comma-separated values format.

 -m HTTP method, one of GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS.
 -H Custom HTTP header. You can specify as many as needed by repeating the flag.
 For example, -H "Accept: text/html" -H "Content-Type: application/xml" .
 -t Timeout for each request in seconds. Default is 20, use 0 for infinite.
 -A HTTP Accept header.
 -d HTTP request body.
 -D HTTP request body from file. For example, /home/user/file.txt or ./file.txt.
 -T Content-type, defaults to "text/html".
 -a Basic authentication, username:password.
 -x HTTP Proxy address as host:port.
 -h2 Enable HTTP/2.

 -host	HTTP Host header.

 -disable-compression Disable compression.
 -disable-keepalive Disable keep-alive, prevents re-use of TCP
 connections between different HTTP requests.
 -disable-redirects Disable following of HTTP redirects
 -cpus Number of used cpu cores.
 (default for current machine is 8 cores)

## Examples

Make requests with default settings:

hey https://google.com

Make 1000 requests with 100 concurrent workers:

hey -n 1000 -c 100 https://google.com

Run load test for 30 seconds:

hey -z 30s https://google.com

Make POST request with custom body:

hey \
 -m POST \
 -d "param1=value1&param2=value2" \
 https://google.com

Add custom headers:

hey \
 -H "Accept: application/json" \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer token" \
 https://google.com

Test with HTTP/2:

hey -h2 https://google.com

Rate limit to 10 queries per second per worker:

hey -q 10 -c 5 -z 30s https://google.com
