# Everything Should Be Typed: Scalar Types Are Not Enough

Recently while working in a codebase, I had a serious bug originating from a very small and minor misuse of arguments to a function which also led to my issue inrust-clippy. I was ranting about it on X too:

Tweet

So I said why not write on why developers shouldn’t stop at scalar types. Imagine a function takes astring, returns anumber, and we call it “typed.” But this is a shallow form of type safety, one that gives us a false sense of security while letting entire categories of bugs slip through unnoticed.

Let me walk you through why scalar types fail us, and what I believe a truly typed codebase should look like.

## The Positional Parameter Problem

Say I have a function that processes a seller payout after an order is delivered. It takes a shop ID, a customer ID, an order ID, the gross amount, platform fee, transaction fee, and net amount.

JavaScript:

function
 
processOrderPayout
(
shopId
,
 
customerId
,
 
orderId
,
 
amount
,
 
platformFee
,
 
txFee
,
 
netAmount
)
 
{

 
// ...

}

Go:

func
 
ProcessOrderPayout
(
shopID
 
string
,
 
customerID
 
string
,
 
orderID
 
string
,
 
amount
 
int64
,
 
platformFee
 
int64
,
 
txFee
 
int64
,
 
netAmount
 
int64
)
 
error
 
{

 
// ...

}

Rust:

fn
 
process_order_payout
(
shop_id
:
 
String
,
 
customer_id
:
 
String
,
 
order_id
:
 
String
,
 
amount
:
 
i64
,
 
platform_fee
:
 
i64
,
 
tx_fee
:
 
i64
,
 
net_amount
:
 
i64
)
 
{

 
// ...

}

Seven parameters. Three IDs that are all strings. Four money values that are all integers. Now imagine somewhere in my codebase, a caller writes this:

process_order_payout
(
customer_id
,
 
shop_id
,
 
order_id
,
 
net_amount
,
 
tx_fee
,
 
platform_fee
,
 
amount
);

The customer ID went in place of the shop ID. The net amount went in place of the gross amount. The fees are swapped. The compiler doesn’t complain. Tests probably pass too. The application runs, pays out the wrong entity, credits the wrong amount, and nobody notices until a seller asks why they received ₦350 instead of ₦54,000.

This is what bit me. The compiler checks theshapeof the data, not themeaning. AStringis aStringis aString, and ani64is ani64is ani64. The type system has no way to tell a shop ID apart from a customer ID, or a gross amount from a net amount, when they share the same underlying type.

## “Just Use a Struct.” Better, But Not Enough

The natural next step is grouping parameters into a struct or object.

JavaScript:

function
 
processOrderPayout
({
 
shopId
,
 
customerId
,
 
orderId
,
 
amount
,
 
platformFee
,
 
txFee
,
 
netAmount
 
})
 
{

 
// ...

}

Go:

type
 
OrderPayoutParams
 
struct
 
{

 
ShopID
 
string

 
CustomerID
 
string

 
OrderID
 
string

 
Amount
 
int64

 
PlatformFee
 
int64

 
TxFee
 
int64

 
NetAmount
 
int64

}

func
 
ProcessOrderPayout
(
params
 
OrderPayoutParams
)
 
error
 
{

 
// ...

}

Rust:

struct
 
OrderPayoutParams
 
{

 
shop_id
:
 
String
,

 
customer_id
:
 
String
,

 
order_id
:
 
String
,

 
amount
:
 
i64
,

 
platform_fee
:
 
i64
,

 
tx_fee
:
 
i64
,

 
net_amount
:
 
i64
,

}

fn
 
process_order_payout
(
params
:
 
OrderPayoutParams
)
 
{

 
// ...

}

This is better. Named fields eliminate positional confusion. You can’t accidentally swapshop_idandcustomer_idwhen you’re explicitly naming them at the call site.

But we’ve only solved one problem. Look at what the structdoesn’tprevent:

let
 
params
 
=
 
OrderPayoutParams
 
{

 
shop_id
:
 
customer_id
,
 
// oops, customer ID assigned to shop field

 
customer_id
:
 
shop_id
,
 
// oops, shop ID assigned to customer field

 
order_id
:
 
order_id
,

 
amount
:
 
net_amount
,
 
// oops, net amount assigned to gross amount field

 
platform_fee
:
 
tx_fee
,
 
// oops, fees are swapped

 
tx_fee
:
 
platform_fee
,

 
net_amount
:
 
amount
,
 
// oops, gross amount assigned to net field

};

The compiler is perfectly happy. Every string field got aString. Every integer field got ani64. The fact thatcustomer_idcontains a customer identifier and not a shop identifier? Invisible to the type system.

This might seem contrived, but it happens all the time in real codebases. Variables get renamed. Data flows through multiple layers. A function receives values from a database row and passes them into a struct, and nobody remembers which column mapped to which field. Someone refactors and swaps two fields, and the compiler catches zero of the call sites that now pass data into the wrong slots.

The struct gave us named assignment, but not semantic correctness. The types are still lying. They say “this field accepts a string” when what we actually mean is “this field accepts ashop identifier.” They say “this field accepts an integer” when what we actually mean is “this field accepts aplatform fee in kobo.”

## The Deeper Problem: Primitives Erase Meaning

This goes way beyond my payout example. Scalar types likestring,int,float, andboolare building blocks, but they carry no domain meaning. When your codebase passes around raw primitives everywhere, you lose the ability to reason about what data actuallymeansat the type level.

Here are bugs I’ve either hit or seen others hit that scalar types will never catch:

Passing a user ID where an order ID is expected.Both areintorstring. Both represent identifiers. But mixing them up means you’re querying the wrong table, charging the wrong customer, or deleting the wrong record.

Mixing up units.A distance in meters passed to a function expecting kilometers. A price in cents passed to a function expecting dollars. A duration in seconds stored in a field labeled “minutes.” All the same type,f64orint, and the compiler won’t say a word.

Confusing sanitized and unsanitized input.A raw user-provided string passed directly into a SQL query or HTML template. The type system seesString. It doesn’t know “this string hasn’t been escaped yet.” This is how injection vulnerabilities happen.

Swapping latitude and longitude.Bothf64. Both coordinates. Swap them and your map renders on the wrong continent.

All of these compile. All of them might pass tests. All of them have caused real production incidents. And all of them are preventable.

## The Solution: Make Invalid States Unrepresentable

The fix is simpler than you’d think. Stop using scalar types for domain concepts. Wrap every meaningful value in its own type.

Rust:

struct
 
ShopId
(
String
);

struct
 
CustomerId
(
String
);

struct
 
OrderId
(
String
);

struct
 
Amount
(
i64
);

struct
 
PlatformFee
(
i64
);

struct
 
TxFee
(
i64
);

struct
 
NetAmount
(
i64
);

struct
 
OrderPayoutParams
 
{

 
shop_id
:
 
ShopId
,

 
customer_id
:
 
CustomerId
,

 
order_id
:
 
OrderId
,

 
amount
:
 
Amount
,

 
platform_fee
:
 
PlatformFee
,

 
tx_fee
:
 
TxFee
,

 
net_amount
:
 
NetAmount
,

}

fn
 
process_order_payout
(
params
:
 
OrderPayoutParams
)
 
{

 
// ...

}

Now try to swap them:

let
 
params
 
=
 
OrderPayoutParams
 
{

 
shop_id
:
 
customer_id
,
 
// ERROR: expected `ShopId`, found `CustomerId`

 
customer_id
:
 
shop_id
,
 
// ERROR: expected `CustomerId`, found `ShopId`

 
order_id
:
 
order_id
,

 
amount
:
 
net_amount
,
 
// ERROR: expected `Amount`, found `NetAmount`

 
platform_fee
:
 
tx_fee
,
 
// ERROR: expected `PlatformFee`, found `TxFee`

 
tx_fee
:
 
platform_fee
,
 
// ERROR: expected `TxFee`, found `PlatformFee`

 
net_amount
:
 
amount
,
 
// ERROR: expected `NetAmount`, found `Amount`

};

The compiler refuses. Not because the data is shaped wrong, but because themeaningis wrong.CustomerIdis notShopId, even though both wrap aStringunderneath.NetAmountis notAmount, even though both wrap ani64.

Go:

type
 
ShopID
 
string

type
 
CustomerID
 
string

type
 
OrderID
 
string

type
 
Amount
 
int64

type
 
PlatformFee
 
int64

type
 
TxFee
 
int64

type
 
NetAmount
 
int64

type
 
OrderPayoutParams
 
struct
 
{

 
ShopID
 
ShopID

 
CustomerID
 
CustomerID

 
OrderID
 
OrderID

 
Amount
 
Amount

 
PlatformFee
 
PlatformFee

 
TxFee
 
TxFee

 
NetAmount
 
NetAmount

}

func
 
ProcessOrderPayout
(
params
 
OrderPayoutParams
)
 
error
 
{

 
// ...

}

Go’s type definitions are not aliases.ShopIDandCustomerIDare distinct types. Passing one where the other is expected is a compile-time error. Same forAmountvsNetAmountvsPlatformFee.

TypeScript:

type
 
ShopId
 
=
 
string
 
&
 
{
 
readonly
 
__brand
:
 
"
ShopId
"
 
};

type
 
CustomerId
 
=
 
string
 
&
 
{
 
readonly
 
__brand
:
 
"
CustomerId
"
 
};

type
 
OrderId
 
=
 
string
 
&
 
{
 
readonly
 
__brand
:
 
"
OrderId
"
 
};

type
 
Amount
 
=
 
number
 
&
 
{
 
readonly
 
__brand
:
 
"
Amount
"
 
};

type
 
PlatformFee
 
=
 
number
 
&
 
{
 
readonly
 
__brand
:
 
"
PlatformFee
"
 
};

type
 
TxFee
 
=
 
number
 
&
 
{
 
readonly
 
__brand
:
 
"
TxFee
"
 
};

type
 
NetAmount
 
=
 
number
 
&
 
{
 
readonly
 
__brand
:
 
"
NetAmount
"
 
};

interface
 
OrderPayoutParams
 
{

 
shopId
:
 
ShopId
;

 
customerId
:
 
CustomerId
;

 
orderId
:
 
OrderId
;

 
amount
:
 
Amount
;

 
platformFee
:
 
PlatformFee
;

 
txFee
:
 
TxFee
;

 
netAmount
:
 
NetAmount
;

}

function
 
processOrderPayout
(
params
:
 
OrderPayoutParams
)
 
{

 
// ...

}

TypeScript doesn’t have native newtype wrappers, so we use branded types. It’s a well-established pattern that adds a phantom property to prevent accidental interchange. A small amount of ceremony that pays for itself immediately.

## Living With Newtypes

The first thing people ask when they see this is “okay but now I can’t do anything with my data.” That’s fair. AShopId(String)doesn’t have.len()or.contains()or any of the methods you’re used to calling onString. You’d have to writeshop_id.0.len()everywhere, and that’s ugly.

This is whereDerefcomes in. In Rust, you can implementDerefto let your newtype transparently expose the inner type’s methods:

use
 
std
::
ops
::
Deref
;

struct
 
ShopId
(
String
);

impl
 
Deref
 
for
 
ShopId
 
{

 
type
 
Target
 
=
 
String
;

 
fn
 
deref
(
&
self
)
 
->
 
&
String
 
{

 
&
self
.0

 
}

}

let
 
shop
 
=
 
ShopId
(
"shop_abc123"
.to_string
());

println!
(
"{}"
,
 
shop
.len
());
 
// works, delegates to String::len()

println!
(
"{}"
,
 
shop
.to_uppercase
());
 
// works too

You get full access to allStringmethods without unwrapping. But the type system still prevents you from passing aShopIdwhere aCustomerIdis expected. Best of both worlds.

You’ll also wantDisplayandFromso your types play nicely with the rest of your code:

use
 
std
::
fmt
;

impl
 
fmt
::
Display
 
for
 
ShopId
 
{

 
fn
 
fmt
(
&
self
,
 
f
:
 
&
mut
 
fmt
::
Formatter
<
'_
>
)
 
->
 
fmt
::
Result
 
{

 
write!
(
f
,
 
"{}"
,
 
self
.0
)

 
}

}

impl
 
From
<
String
>
 
for
 
ShopId
 
{

 
fn
 
from
(
s
:
 
String
)
 
->
 
Self
 
{

 
ShopId
(
s
)

 
}

}

// Now you can do:

let
 
shop
:
 
ShopId
 
=
 
"shop_abc123"
.to_string
()
.into
();

println!
(
"Processing payout for {shop}"
);

And here’s where it gets really powerful. You can add validation directly in the constructor, so invalid data can never become aShopIdin the first place:

impl
 
ShopId
 
{

 
pub
 
fn
 
new
(
id
:
 
String
)
 
->
 
Result
<
Self
,
 
String
>
 
{

 
if
 
id
.is_empty
()
 
{

 
return
 
Err
(
"Shop ID cannot be empty"
.into
());

 
}

 
if
 
!
id
.starts_with
(
"shop_"
)
 
{

 
return
 
Err
(
"Shop ID must start with 'shop_'"
.into
());

 
}

 
Ok
(
ShopId
(
id
))

 
}

}

Once aShopIdexists in your system, youknowit’s valid. Every function that receives aShopIdcan skip validation entirely. The constructor already did the work.

In Go, defined types start with an empty method set, but built-in operations likelen()still work and you can add your own methods:

type
 
ShopID
 
string

id
 
:=
 
ShopID
(
"shop_abc123"
)

fmt
.
Println
(
len
(
id
))
 
// works, len() is a built-in function

// Add your own methods

func
 
(
id
 
ShopID
)
 
Validate
()
 
error
 
{

 
if
 
id
 
==
 
""
 
{

 
return
 
errors
.
New
(
"shop ID cannot be empty"
)

 
}

 
return
 
nil

}

In TypeScript, branded types are just structural, so allstringornumberoperations work without any extra code. The brand only exists at compile time.

## What You Actually Gain

This isn’t just about catching swapped arguments. It changes how you think about your code.

Self-documenting code.When a function takesShopIdinstead ofString, you don’t need a doc comment explaining what that parameter is. The typeisthe documentation.

Refactoring confidence.When you rename a field or change a data flow, the compiler traces every usage of that type across your entire codebase. Nothing slips through.

Validation at the boundary.When you construct aShopId, you can enforce invariants: must be a valid ObjectID format, can’t be empty, must exist in the database. EveryShopIdin your system is guaranteed valid. Not because every function checks, but because the constructor checked once and the type system carries that guarantee forward.

Grep-ability.Searching forShopIdin your codebase shows you every place a shop identifier is created, passed, stored, or transformed. Searching forStringshows you everything.

Security.ARawUserInputtype that must be explicitly converted toSanitizedHtmlbefore rendering? That’s injection prevention enforced by the compiler, not by code review discipline.

## The Cost Is Lower Than You Think

The most common objection is ceremony. “I don’t want to wrap every string in a newtype.” But think about the alternative: you’re trusting that every developer on your team, across every PR, in every late-night hotfix, will correctly match unnamed strings to their intended purpose. That’s not engineering. That’s hope.

The wrapper types are typically two to five lines each. You write them once. The compiler enforces them forever.

Scalar types describe what datalooks like. A sequence of characters, a 64-bit integer, a boolean flag. Domain types describe what datameans. A title, a price in USD, a sanitized HTML fragment, a user ID.

The gap between these two is where bugs live. I learned that the hard way. Wrap your primitives. Make your types mean something. Let the compiler do the work that code review and testing never will.
