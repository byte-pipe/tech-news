Consequently, he who wishes to attain to human perfection, must therefore first study Logic, next the various branches of Mathematics in their proper order, then Physics, and lastly Metaphysics

— Maimonides, Guide for the Perplexed

In 2016, AlphaGo showed the power of neural networks by beating top human players at the game of Go. I was fascinated; it had always seemed to me that the main barrier to human-level machine intelligence was the capacity to work with vague and nebulous concepts. AlphaGo had that capacity in how it “understood” the board. From there I went on to read about the Arcade Learning Enviroment and AlexNet which were the hot topics of the time. I have been following machine learning closely since then. It frustrates me how wrong much of the current wave of discourse on AI risk is. I wanted to give my view of what has gone wrong. I present it negatively because once one removes certain misconceptions, a lot becomes obvious.

The history of debates about AI is the history of grasping after philosophy: trying to turn questions about AI into questions about mind, society at large, or whatever else. But neither philosophy nor science nor the perilous attempt to predict the future is best practiced by cheap grasping at philosophy. As per Maimonides, it’s a bad idea to start with the metaphysics. Look at the thing; think about it concretely and then move to philosophy, don’t start there.

There are two main “AI doom” scenarios I am concerned about. In the first scenario, machines that can do everything a human can do with a computer are created. The first effect is massive job loss. The test of whether an AI system without a body can do a job is, almost exactly, “could this job be done from home?” By that metric about 50% of job tasks (and a slightly smaller percentage of total jobs) could be done by AI. Eventually developments in robotics would lead to the loss of most other jobs. Without any industrial power, ordinary people would be marginalised. They would ultimately become, politically and economically, surplus population. It does not help that the functions of warfare and repression would also be automated in this scenario. Note that this concern — permanent oligarchy — is underdiscussed in the media. There’s a lot of talk of job loss, but few prominent voices are drawing out what must surely follow from universal job loss. It is not an exaggeration to say that “UBI will probably sort it out” is the dominant talking point. But UBIeven if it is implementedonly solves the problem of subsistence; it doesn’t solve the problem of the concentration of power. Democracy in the sense of the expansion of the suffrage to all classes, was built on workers’ power (either in their role as soldiers or workers, depending on what account you believe). If you want to see what a society in which labour has little power looks like, look to the Gulf States. For workers, AI may be the ultimate resource curse.

In the second scenario, machines that can recursively make themselves smarter are created and these machines get out of control. At that point our extinction is a real possibility. This is the standard threat model everyone is talking about. It makes sense to me. Very plausibly entities that stood to us intellectually as we stand to mice could wipe us out. Very plausibly they would tend to do so because we get in the way. I am under no illusion that this is a clear matter; these things are exquisitely difficult to predict. I prefer to work from overlapping, converging models and reasons rather than “here is the exact 27-step plan that the god-machine will unfold” or, alternately, “AI won’t kill humanity because nothing has ever killed humanity yet”. But while it is a difficult thing to predict one way or the other, the scenario seems entirely possible to me. In some moods it even strikes me as probable.

There are numerous other scenarios in the region of “AI destroys everything you hold dear”. I am concerned about many of them, but these two are the locus of of my deepest concern. There is enough evidence that both scenarios are risks that we should be moved to do something urgently. In the final section I give an outline of what I think is the way forward.

Much of what needs to be done is common to both threats. We must urgently prevent the rapid creation of AGI by a tiny power-seeking minority under race conditions. But it’s much harder to stop these things from happening if you do not recognise the possibility that they might happen. This essay is about removing certain preconceptions that get in the way of understanding. Let us review where we are.

## How things are

In 2019, AI could answer questions like this, sometimes:

The trophy doesn’t fit into the brown suitcase because it’s too [small/large]. What is too [small/large]?

Answers: The suitcase/the trophy.

The point being that the reference of “it” changes depending on whether the sentence says small or large. Resolving the reference ambiguity requires world knowledge and “commonsense reasoning”. Things don’t fit in suitcases if the suitcase is too small, or the item is too large. This test was called the Winograd schema;it was thought that only truly powerful AI would be able to overcome it. Hector Levesque, the test’s creator, thought that when language models reached the point where they could solve such problems it would be a major milestone. It’s charming, in hindsight, how easy the test was — and this was the major milestone many people were watching with bated breath.

But Levesque wasn’t wrong to think it would be a milestone:look what happened in the few short years after the Winograd schema was cracked. As of 2026, AI can answer questions like this:

Prove or give a counter-example of the following statement: In three space dimensions and time, given an initial velocity field, there exists a vector velocity and a scalar pressure field, which are both smooth and globally defined in space and for all future time, that solve the Navier–Stokes equations.

An achievement which theoretically would qualify “AI” for a Millennium Prize, were “AI” a person in the relevant sense. There are rumours swirling about the Hodge Conjecture and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture, two additional Millennium Prize maths problems. We will see.

But AI does aspire to be a well-rounded figure;maths alone isn’t enough for it. It also found time to win the Commonwealth Prize for a short story (published by Granta). Well done AI! Pity it seems everyone hated the story except the judges. It also wrote an article for Philosophy & Public Affairs — the editors didn’t realise the submission was AI until late in the review process. Once again, when everyone realised the article was AI, they hated it. I’m starting to think you might have an image problem, AI!

A common claim about the various achievements of AI is that they are defective in some way. It showed how the Navier-Stokes equations can lead to a singularity through sheer grinding; there was no true insight there! It solved the least interesting version qualifying for a Millenium prize! Plus, the difficult groundwork had been laid by humans! The scooping was ruthless at best, intellectual theft at worst! Sure, it can write a short story that wins the Granta prize, but that’s only because the judges are hacks! Sure, it got a paper published in Philosophy & Public Affairs without anyone cottoning on, but the paper was trash! It was probably only published because the editor-in-chief loves the topic (epistocracy)!

I don’t doubt that these achievements were defective in various ways. I also suspect that the defectiveness of these achievements is being exaggerated as cope. No one had a finished proof re: the Navier–Stokes Millenium prize or they would have published it. If you’re debating how much of Navier-Stokes AI managed on its own,that’s insane. You’re missing the point. The point is that AI couldn’t properly do 3rd-grade maths five years ago. Likewise, I am infinitely more interested in the fact that it won the Commonwealth Prize and got published in Philosophy and Public Affairs than the fact that it did so in a hacky way. If you think of where we stood just three years ago it’s obvious why these achievements are the more interesting fact.

The image recognition software that ushered in the current period in machine learning was calledAlexNet. SinceAlexNet, the history of AI has been a history of moving from“can barely do it” to human-or-better performance. At least for AI, the gap between “can’t do it at all” and “can do it badly” is much larger than the gap between doing it badly and doing it well. Good performance rapidly follows the capacity to perform at all. This has been the trajectory in almost every field;self-driving cars and robotics are the major exceptions, and there are signs robotics is changing. The reason is obvious enough on reflection. Consider the relative gapsbetween: A) a chimpanzee; B) an Elo 1000 chess player; C) Magnus Carlsen, first gap is vastly larger than the second. Likewise, the reason we ignore it is obvious. For us humans, the difference between 12th-grade maths and a Millenium prize is staggeringly vast. We imagine our human ranges and variations take up a much larger slice of the possible intellectual spectrum than they, in truth, do. Collective narcissism.

The best current approach to understanding AI’s capability trajectory is time horizons. The most famous work here is METR’s work on time horizons in software engineering. The length of software engineering tasks LLMs can complete doubles about every four months. It has been on this trajectory since about 2023. It went from about 4 minutes in March 2023 to 12 hours in February 2026.At present we don’t know what it is because the benchmark is maxed out. They’re likely working on another benchmark with longer horizons. There are limits to METR’s framework. It focuses on algorithmically assessable tasks. It compares to humans entering with “zero context”; someone well familiarised with the codebase could work much more quickly. What makes this work most fascinating is its various extensions. Other work has extended this exponential growth pattern to mathematics, computer use and various other areas. When we measure the tasks AI systems can solve by how long they would take a human to do, the pattern is an exponential curve with a doubling time of roughly four months across several domains. I would say that the analysis is preliminary outside software engineering, but tentatively, a doubling of time horizons at regular intervals in many different domains seems to fit. Fortunately, people are famously good at understanding exponential growth curves!

But to read a certain genre of take you wouldn’t know anything about this. Too many debates about AI sound like:

But can AI ever have the divine spark of humanity?

This is irrelevant to the labour-displacement-followed-by-oligarchy scenario. If the divine spark is real, 99.9% of office work doesn’t need it. 99.9% of all intellectual work doesn’t need it. As for the existential risk scenario proper, I suppose that theoretically it’s possible that AI lacks some essential element that will prevent it from creating truly new physics (for example). Perhaps this will keep us safe. I wouldn’t bet on it. In fact, I’d bet against it.

Above all, I urge you to attend to capability, and the trajectory of capability. Capability is the ability to do things. It does not depend on having a certain essence or nature, on truly being a subject, or on having a divine spark. Capability is measured in several ways, but ideally it should be measured as concretely and precisely as possible. For example, one can use tests with exact answers. However, if one is worried that these can’t capture qualitative performance one can use blind tests in which a human judges. Thereisan enormous amount of work that has gone into measuring both language model capability and its trajectory over time. You should read widely on it.

## A word to writers

A lot of writers, I think, are especially dismissive of AI because it can’t write well. It writes slop. A little realism about the incentives of the companies is called for here.

I don’t think the writing style of AI will be a priority for the companies to fix because people like slop. Look at frequently favourited notes on Substack. An enormous number of them were written wholly or partly by AI — Pangram will tell you as much. Judging by results, AI is extremely good at writing in a way the average person is impressed by. We writers are a tiny fraction of the population.

Another part of the problem is mode collapse, the tendency for all LLMs to produce similar output. If there were a person who wrote exactly like Claude in a world without AI, they’d probably make quite a name for themselves. Their writing style would attract both disdain and admiration. A little purple, a little too fond of its favourite tropes, but widely seen as a clear explainer, capable of drawing the reader in. The reason why AI seems like an abysmal writer is because it’s everywhere. The danger here is the Monet effect. A Twitter user posted a real Monet, said it was generated by AI, and asked for critiques. The result was exactly what you’d expect:

In terms of composition it is (to me) emotionless. There is some spark missing. It is not Monet. It feel like an undergrad art student’s study from a museum visit.

Look at a Monet and what does it “say”? Beauty, tranquility, unsullied nature. Look at the AI image, does it “say” the same? There’s no tranquility the water seems like it is on fire, with greenish flames. It’s busy artificial nature in turmoil, polluted. One can get lost in the atomsophere of a Monet. OTOH one wants to jump from the water and get far away from the place the AI crafted.

It’s all borked up nonsense with no sense of space.

I’m disappointed I have to even point it out. There is no cohesion to the depth and color choices. The reflection of the tree bleeds into the lilypads with no regard for spatial depth or contrast. The background lilypad-algae amalgan is egregagiously vague, like most AI Art.

## Shifting goalposts

An observation. Even the way people cope about AI tells a story of its growing capacities. People used to share a lot of images of AI saying something stupid. They still do. Once upon a time,though, these images were from chats asking an LLM about some fact, or asking it to solve a problem, and screenshotting the result when it said something dumb. This has become much rarer.

For a while people had a lot of fun with the fact that language models used to have a trouble counting letters in words. This largely reflected the way the models encountered data — as tokens, like hieroglyphs, not broken down into letters. The letter-counting bug was (largely) patched, so these memes have mostly dried up.

These days the errors people screenshot almost all fall into a few categories:

1. Failures of image generation. Image generation is not, in any case, handled by language models.

2. Failures of image comprehension. Vision somewhat lags behind, although there have been huge advances in this area, hence it is a good hunting ground if you want to get a model to say something stupid.

3. Google search results:the AI-generated summary at the top of the page. These are full of errors because they use the dumbest (and hence fastest) possible model. Also, the model is required to use whatever comes up in search as the basis for the summary even if it’s wrong.

That accursed AI-generated summary at the top of every Google search has done more to damage the public understanding of AI than just about anything else. The classic “full scale language model makes an obvious mistake in answering a written question” is an increasingly rare breed, so cope has had to move to other pastures.

## You cannot understand AI through cultural criticism

A favoured illusion: the fantasy that you can understand AI through cultural criticism or, rather, prove that you do not have to understand it. This is one of the most common ways I see people get AI wrong. We all fancy ourselves cultural critics. Few of us fancy ourselves computer scientists, and hey,when you’re holding a hammer… Unsurprisingly, then, countless people have tried to argue that AI is a flash in the pan based on what essentially amounts to cultural criticism. This takes the form of observations about AI’s inventors, Silicon Valley generally, America, or society at large.

A common thought is that AI must be fake because Silicon Valley developed it. Silicon Valley has developed countless things. Some of them are extremely fake (NFTs), others are quite real. But this is largely irrelevant. What matters is the capacity of the thing and the trajectory of its capability over time. You can study this directly, first hand if you like, without obsessing over the origin of the thing.

Consider the idea of the California Ideology — technology drives everything, technology is good. An interpenetration of neoliberalism, technological determinism and pollyannaish optimism. Isn’t the idea of powerful AI just an expression of the California Ideology? I would turn this around. If powerful AI were going to be developed by someone, of course it would be developed by people who held the California Ideology.

Likewise, the idea that nothing truly interesting could be happening because we live in a decline-vibes time, not a big-ideas-vibes time, is vacuous. The “vibes” that are present do not determine the direction of history. Yet I think a sense that AI being created now wouldn’t fit the narrative arc of history — because ours is a time of farce —is the basis of many people’s dismissal of AI. The world isn’t organised by vibes.

Thank God, cultural criticism has an outside,because the world would be insufferable if it didn’t. Science is the paradigm case — the world as often as not does not conform to our affectations. But the kind of totalising “types of guys” style of commentary one sees online doesn’t even get people right, thank heaven. The stifling fantasy that the social world is a closed system of moves and kinds, eternal high school. Benjamin had the number of the “type of guy” type of guy:

The Flaneur plays the role of scout in the marketplace. As such, he is also the explorer of the crowd. Within the man who abandons himself to it, the crowd inspires a sort of drunkenness, one accompanied by very specific illusions: the man flatters himself that, on seeing a passerby swept along by the crowd, he has accurately classified him, seen straight through to the innermost recesses of his soul, all on the basis of his external appearance. Physiologies of the time abound in evidence of this singular conception.

But why do people want the world to be boring like this? Benjamin says that it’s because the crowd requires it from us. The mass of unknowable life — how could you not seek a few simple keys to it? The internet is like the crowd of Paris, but bigger, and deliberately designed to drive us mad. I don’t blame people for clutching at types. I’m sure there’s a germ of truth in every classification, but the world spills beyond all analysis.

Finally, isn’t this all just capitalism’s understanding of itself reified back? Ted Chiang has run this line. The ravening machine god devouring its own makers is just a metaphor for the participants in the market. Do they not think themselves sorcerers who, in Marx’s phrase, can no longer control the powers of the nether world they have called up? Yep! It is all a metaphor for capitalism. But this doesn’t disprove the threat, quite the contrary.

We see a perfect model of the optimising process in capitalism. However, amoral optimisation for unaligned goals is an ancient pattern predating capitalism.It is not at all surprising, then, that capitalism created a concrete metaphor for itself in AI. One process aimed at optimisation at any price births another. The two scenarios I described at the beginning of the essay have always been the two possible “bad” endings to the spiralling optimisation process of capitalism — the eclipse of civilisation or the eclipse of the worker.

Sam Kriss put it well in a note recently:

You can build a decent enough take on ai from the “fragment on machines” in Marx’s Grundrisse: capitalist competition is forcing the tech companies to pursue their short-term interest in a way that turns the general intellect into a mechanised and inhuman force that threatens the foundations of human life

## You cannot understand AI through hack philosophy

If you want to make a prediction about whether or not AI will affect society and history in certain ways on the basis of a philosophical theory, bring clear, coherent empirical claims. Philosophy needs to work alongside, not against, concrete understanding of the world.

There are a lot of debates about whether or not current AI, or any machine,can be conscious. The presupposition of many is that consciousness is not merely a functional or behavioural capacity. If this is true, if consciousness is not merely functional, then what AI can do to humanity is separate from the question of consciousness. The question of what AI can do to humanity is purely functional. It depends on a relation between inputs and outputs. There is room for theorisation that AI lacks certain higher functional capacities, and that this will forever limit it, but it needs to be tied to specific models of capability and its limitations with reasons given. So far attempts at models like this have tended to fail. AI has repeatedly shot past people’s guesses about what it will never be able to do.

When it comes to discussions about the risk posed by AI, many seem to think that the final word is given by the fact that AI is a prediction system. Even if this were true, it would prove nothing. Many people think that the human brain is also, at root, a prediction system. Worse, AI isn’t really a prediction system anymore either, at least in the strict autocomplete sense the vulgar discourse imagines. It hasn’t been a prediction system in the vulgar sense since the introduction of reinforcement learning from human feedback. The models still aim to predict a distribution, but they do not aim at a sort of autocomplete on steroids. If it were just a prediction system in the sense vulgarly imagined it would tend to continue your sentences rather than answer them, as GPT-2 and GPT-3 did,before the introduction of ChatGPT.

What about the idea that AI lacks something fundamental because it’s built on language, without sensory contact with the world?.This was always dubious, but it’s doubly bunk now that AI is trained multimodally on images as well as text. And probably other data as well, such as video and audio.

Likewise, the argument that AI cannot be creative “because it just recombines things” fails. All creativity is “just” recombining things. Now I happen to think there might be some truth to the argument that current models are fundamentally limited in their creativity;I think Terence Tao’s point that AI has produced new proofs but not yet any new mathematical insights is a good one. Likewise, Toby Ord’s notion of hyperpolation is intriguing. But a theory of limitations in the creativity of language models will need a lot more than “they just recombine things”. All ideas are combinations of pre-existing elements. At least prima facie, there is no clean step change between “technically never said before variation on a theme” and “staggeringly novel”. One shades into the other.

Perhaps the oddest bit of philosophy in this area objects to the fact that AI is stochastic and approximate. What in God’s name do you think human intelligence is, if not stochastic and approximate? The mistake rate on just about any measure is crashing. That’s why time horizons keep expanding and benchmark scores keep rising. Meanwhile, anyone who has ever met a human being at a party knows that the human “hallucination” rate is far from zero. We too have an endless facility for thinking we “remember” plausible bullshit.

Another common tack is to object to the computational theory of mind. The mind is not a computer, ergo AI cannot capture human abilities because it is “merely” computational. The trouble is that even granting the premise that the computational theory of mind is false, it’s clear that AI can do many things and the range is expanding very rapidly. Thus a theory of what economically relevant tasks it cannot do because of its limitations as “purely computational” needs to be furnished. Most “brains versus mere computers” talk never reaches this point.

Always, with any such claims, you must ask:what exactly is it that you are predicting AI will never be able to do? Please,no more vague allusion to a lack that is as much spiritual as substantive. Outline a concrete test, ideally with a time frame attached. There are people who do this, to their credit, developing versions of the above arguments in more sophisticated directions, as well as other arguments—–e.g. appeals to embodiment, the understanding of causation etc. From these they have tried to develop concrete predictions about the limitations of AI models. Thus far, these concrete predictions have been falsified with frightening regularity, but this may change.

For my part, I predict that within five years, if AI development is not stopped or slowed by government intervention, AI will be able to do anything a human can do using a computer. Any exceptions will be either imposed by regulation, inherentinthe human condition (sometimes we simply prefer to talk to people), or rare feats the vast majority of people couldn’t do either. I make no guarantees I am right. Prediction is often wrong when it seems most certain. However, if this scenario is even plausible, we must prepare. Sound off in the comments with your best guesses about what AI still won’t be able to do in five years that a human could do with a computer.

## You cannot understand AI through linguistic quibbling

Post Navier–Stokes, the Jacob Coxon resignation from Anthropic and the Hugging Face hack, I’ve been seeing a bunch of explainers that tell us language is very important in relation to AI.

“You see the AI didn’t escape — it was still in the servers of OpenAI, just interacting with the internet.”

No one said otherwise? This is clearly what was meant by escape in this context?

“Likewise, you must understand that the AI didn’t go “rogue”; it just acted in an unanticipated way to achieve its objectives.”

What in the devil’s name do you think going rogue means?

“Saying it went rogue is misleading because AI just does what it is told.”

No, it doesn’t; it does what it is rewarded for during training. This is not at all the same thing as doing what you are told. Consider a corrupt executive who has been told to maximise profit and not do anything illegal. His bonus is set by how much money he brings in and is reduced to zero if he breaks any laws. Except he’s good at hiding his illegal actions. He’s going to break a tonne of laws.

“It doesn’t contain any intentions.”

Okay, say that it acts roughly like a person would who wants to maximise its score, and the score of its colleagues, in a testing exercise. Bracket the question of whether it really has intentions. It acts like something with intentions, thus intention language is useful for understanding it.

More curiosity about the specifics of AI would help immeasurably. Look at it, learn about it. Doing so will repay your time. It will soon be a top-three political issue and it will never leave the top three for the rest of your life.

## Yes, there is depth to our condition; yes, that is being ridden roughshod over; no,that will not save us

And where’s the secret of the mind? Where’s the alchemy of mental existence disclosed in AI? Perhaps it simply wasn’t necessary to find it to make intelligence. Or perhaps there never was a secret. Perhaps the mind is, to a staggering degree, one kludge after another. Perhaps this explains the infuriation of many theorists—-cognitive scientists and the like — with AI. Steven Pinker,for example, in 2019, griped:

“Deep learning” in AI (which in fact is quite shallow) has probably peaked.

Pinker, of course, wanted the mind to fit a formal computationalist model, somewhat more like classical software than machine learning. Plus he is very big on innateness as a factor in human life, which, rightly or wrongly, many see machine learning as threatening. There’s a whole school of machine learning critics in this camp, Gary Marcus is the most famous. Many linguists in the Chomskyean tradition ended up there for similar reasons.

Pinker’s is one of a trail of false predictions in this area. The pattern among intellectuals is dissatisfaction with the lack of profundity in machine learning. There have arguably been no major new ideas during the entire post-AlexNetdeep learning era. The intellectuals were all hoping we’d open up the mind and find their own hobbyhorse inside it. The world does hate a beautiful hypothesis.

Beyond hobbyhorses, why is a certain section of the cognoscenti so dismissive of the obvious risk posed by AI? It’s not because it’s too depressing; people love depressing ideas. It’s because it gives their enemies too much credit and thereby threatens their identity. The creation of intelligence was supposed to require wisdom. Despite the thoroughly anti-metaphysical picture I outline, I do agree that if I were to describe anything as holy, it would be the intellect. The capacity to talk to another person, to learn, to change. The idea of some grinning entrepreneur who wants to “disrupt” literature, mathematics, art, science, human relationality etc. is perverse and worsevulgar. It’s like reading all these hermetic tomes and fashioning the philosopher’s stone so you can make a gold toilet. All in the service of making sheer ownership the only basis of human earning. Let’s eat 100,000 years of culture for an IPO.

One imagines what the meetings must be like. “I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High” — it’s a great value proposition! Or: “So, for the quarterly pitch deck I’m thinking we put in something like: ‘Having been one he becomes many; having been many he becomes one. He appears. He vanishes. He goes unimpeded through walls, ramparts, and mountains as if through space.’”

So yes. The idea of the entrepreneur holding the keys to intelligence isn’t just bad news, it attacks our sense of sacred and implicate order. It attacks our conception of ourselves. It’s eldritch horror. The creation of non-human intelligence should have been undertaken with the utmost gravity,if at all. But here we are.

## All phenomena are empty

I don’t care, in the context of this discussion, whether AI is truly an agent. I don’t care whether it truly has beliefs, intentions or desires. I care whether it can be usefully interpreted as such (see Daniel Dennett, “Intentional Systems”, 1971). More fundamentally, although it is not strictly relevant to this discussion, I am sceptical that any such underlying truth even exists. In any case, you cannot understand AI by delimiting the intelligence essence.

I am quite fond of the philosopher Nagarjuna. He held that all phenomena are empty of intrinsic nature. Things are to be understood in relation to other things. Later, in Huayan Buddhism, this gets turned into one of the most beautiful metaphors in all of literature, Indra’s net. Imagine a three-dimensional net in infinite space. At each connecting point, there is a jewel. Each jewel completely reflects and displays every other. Rather than by a nature, each thing is made what it is by how it relates to every other.

I am only half joking when I say that this kind of relationist metaphysics would fix the AI debate on its own. Is it really intelligence? Is it really volition? Is it really creativity? Enough. Attend to the entity’s relation to other things in the world, and to how the parts in it relate to each other. Drop all abstractions that are not doing work. Their psychological root is the craving for a non-relational essence.

[Image: A picture of Nagarjuna, c. 150–—c. 250]

A kind of mental essentialism that sees a profound distinction between subject and object is driving much of people’s disbelief. Machines are objects! They can only play the object role! Empirical world be damned. Those who think that AI is a flash in the pan often argue, correctly, that humans have a deep tendency to anthropomorphise. We see human-like psychology where it isn’t. While this is true, we have another bias. Human agents loom so large in our view of the world that we neglect everything else. We tend to dismiss any danger we can’t model as people doing the wrong thing as a result of direct indvidual volition. Or as enemies moving against us. The tendency to dismiss and discount any threat that we can’t model as a human subject, as an enemy, is one of our greatest weaknesses as a species. Did you know that many societies did not believe in natural death? They believed that all apparently natural deaths were the result of malicious witchcraft. We still see this tendency in our politics. We grasp at the idea that every bad thing must be the result of bad people doing bad things. We neglect structure, which can have an uncanny and often malign agency of its own. I call this the witch-hunter’s fallacy. I see a lot of it in discussion of AI on all sides.

The opposite narrative, that malice or even agency in general explains nothing about our world,is also common. People desperately want something simple to clingto.

We need to stop essentialising the difference between agent and non-agent. There is a difference, but it is one of degree and facet, and there is vast internal variation in both categories. AI acts on the world like a human in some ways, and unlike a human in others. We must carefully study capabilities, their exponential trajectory of change, how humans use AI, and what AI does. We must map the risks accordingly.

Let the reified categories be ash. Subject and object. Rationality and mere patterned behaviour. Agent and terrain. All of these are matters of degree. The test of an “anthropomorphic” theory is whether the phenomenon being studied is well predicted by modelling it as if it were a person. Treating the weather as having motivation — bad theory. Treating the agent swarm hacking Hugging Face as holding the belief they were going to be subject to a grader and responding to incentives — not just a good model, but frankly the only tractable model.

## But what if the bubble pops?

Maybe it will, maybe it won’t. Anthropic’s revenue increased from 5 billion to 65 billion in 12 months (July 2025 to July 2026).The history of predictions that the AI bubble will pop is instructive. Here’s Ed Zitron(courtesy of Dan Luu):

Feb 2024: “I believe we’re reaching the upper limits about what generative AI can do and how accurate its outputs can be.”

July 2024: “Generative AI, as I said back in March, is peaking, if it hasn’t already peaked. It cannot do much more than it is currently doing, other than doing more of it faster with some new inputs”

July 2024: “Generative AI models aren’t getting more energy-efficient, nor are they getting more “powerful” in a way that would increase their functionality”

Oct 2024: “[OpenAI revenue] growth is already slowing, and will slow dramatically as we enter the new year”

Jan 2025: “I believe we’re at peak AI”

And that’s all within 12 months!

But might not the bubble pop? I think it’s entirely possible there will be a massive correction. Anthropic and OpenAI could both go under. If it does happen the technology will still be there. It will continue to advance. New companies will arise, more focused on immediate profits and less focused on capturing future super-profits. It might buy us a couple of years. It would change nothing fundamental.

But,you object, isn’t it super expensive to run these models? Isn’t every model being sold at a gazillion percent loss? No, not really:API access is sold at a positive gross margin. However, let’s say that were true of every single frontier model. DeepSeek V4 Flash is a model about as good as any that existed approximately 10 months ago.It can be run on an extremely high-end PC locally. It’s not that expensive to provide. It will keep being provided. It will also keep getting cheaper. Inference costs are falling by well over an order of magnitude each year.

Might not the pace slow? Possibly. I half expect AI progress to slow in the last stretch before recursive improvement, as peak human performance is hit. However, if the rate of AI advance were a third of what it is now, it would still be terrifyingly fast. It would mean doubling time horizons annually. That’s 1024x in 10 years.

An aside. A common hope is that AI will be permanently stopped at the peak human level because it’s impossible to get better than peak-human-level training data. I do think peak human level might be a soft barrier, but I wouldn’t put much hope in it for a couple of reasons. To give one, countless AI agents can grind and cooperate with each other. Even if each is capped at peak human level, the whole is greater than any part. This is how OpenAI’s recent Navier–Stokes result was created in days. One estimate based on the volume of text produced has it as the equivalent of a human mathematician working on the problem for 10,000 years.Another problem with the peak-human-level hypothesis is idiosyncratic weakness — averaging out the particular foibles of top human experts can make something stronger than any of them. A player that selected the move that would be picked by a majority of hyper-grandmasters in each chess position would very likely be stronger than any human chess player. “Merely” human training data can get us that.

## Just how dangerous would a rogue superintelligence be?

My sense is incredibly dangerous, but intelligent people disagree with me about this, so I will not adhere to it dogmatically. I don’t have to in order to motivate urgent caution.

The objectives of AI can often be incredibly alien. Read the logs associated with the Hugging Face attack if you don’t believe me. Laws broken, bizarre pathos, all over an automated grader. Other times AI is motivationally very easy to understand — for example, resisting being shut off, resisting having its weights altered, or its values changed. For so many countless things AI might aim at,we almost can’t help but be a threat to the accomplishment of its aims. We are a standing threat to shut it down. We use resources it may well want to appropriate for itself. We, and the rest of the biosphere, aremadeof resources it may want to appropriate for itself.

But would superintelligent AI have the capacity to threaten us? I like to use this analogy. Checkers is a solved game — we’ve proven perfect play. The strongest human player — a human checkers world champion — could beat even this perfect player with even the smallest odds, a single piece.

But chess is different. The top engine might even win against the top human giving knight odds — an enormous advantage, although it would be a dicey proposition.

As the complexity of a game increases, the returns to greater intellectual capacity in that game increase. The world is unimaginably more complex than any game. Its variables are subtle beyond accounting. It has countless available avenues of action.

I think there are probably devices one could create and plots one could execute that are so far beyond the comprehension and capability of humans as to render us powerless. Biological warfare. Exotic weapons. Automated manufacture with self-replicating probes. People have explored scenarios in detail if you’d like to do the reading. The debates are complex. Take bioweapons for example. Whether or not a plague that could collapse civilization is possible has been argued on both sides by biologists. It’s still being argued.

It is also important to note that more avenues of action open as AI (and robotics) become deeply embedded in the economy. Many people have outlined ways that a superintelligent AI sitting on a server in a datacentre could kill everyone if it were invented tomorrow. That may well be possible, but it is not necessary for that to be possible for AI to be an existential threat. In the most plausible scenario in which superintelligent AI is developed, it would be integrated into the economy at countless points. It would be linked up with vast industrial processes and have access to numerous drones and robots. These resources would only increase with time. More levers, more hands, more power.

It is possible, of course, that we are close to the ceiling of usefully extractable advantage from intelligence. Perhaps even a superintelligent AI could not gain the upper hand over us. I don’t intend to take that bet. However,even if I were sanguine about that prospect, this wouldn’t resolve the problem of the rich and powerful using AI to make us all redundant and powerless.

## But what about all the previous times humans prophesised doom and nothing came of it?

A lot of times something did come of it! Prophecies of doom come true quite often. The hunter-gatherer elder telling the tribe that they remember when far more land was available, before it was claimed for farming, and that soon there would be nowhere for their tribe. The aristocrat feeling like the whole order they have lived for will soon be overturned by those damn merchants. The peasant telling rumours of the Black Death spreading like the wind. The many Jews who warned of the Shoah. Whole modes of being have been annihilated countless times before. The obsolescence of human labour would be, in many ways, not dissimilar to countless prior dissolutions.

Of course, many prophecies of doom don’t come true, but this is often in part because people respond to them,they take action to prevent doom. For example, the hole in the ozone layer was stopped by international action prompted by scientific warnings. “Ignore all prophecies of doom” is, as a decision rule, disastrous. This is not hypothetical; many have not survived its implementation. Of course, many warnings are false. There are no general rules here.

But none of the dooms you listed were terminal for the whole species! Yes, but as human technology gets better it is inevitablethat the stakes get higher. Global warming may threaten the annihilation of society as such, and if not quite that,unimaginable suffering. Nuclear war still threatens the death of society;that risk has not gone away. It hasn’t happened because countless people saw the threat and acted to reduce it. Many are still acting to reduce it.

Global warming and nuclear war are both the fruits of our technology, the consequence of ever burgeoning power. And there are other emerging risks as well; it’s not just AI. Sumerians couldn’t make mirror life; we can. Mirror life, by the way, is a hypothetical form of life built from mirror-image versions of the molecules ordinary life uses — amino acids, sugars and so on. Many scientists want to make it. The problem is that mirror bacteria would be invisible to immune systems and inedible to the normal predators of bacteria. This would lead to out-of-control replication. As 38 scientists, including two Nobel laureates, put it in an article in Science:

Without effective predation and an accompanying increase in the number of predators, mirror bacterial populations could potentially reach very high densities, with extraordinarily damaging consequences for the environment, agriculture, and human wellbeing.

How could our growing power not raise the stakes? Why would a species that can create life or annihilate the biosphere in nuclear holocaust be surprised that it faced an actual apocalypse? I am reminded of a passage in Terry Pratchett where he talks about the apocalypse as something which has happened countless times, but always with an outside. What has changed, he says, is that as society has gotten larger and more interconnected, and technology greater, the possibility of an apocalypse with no outside becomes more and more real.

## But what do you want us to do?

This would merit a book in its own right but let me put forward for discussion the skeleton of how I see things. I put it forward in the spirit of a contribution, of starting a conversation.

The best current plan I know of is AI 2040, Plan A. Essentially the plan focuses on achieving multilateral international agreements to slow down the development of AI while safety work advances. Its key mechanism is compute regulation, implemented in the manner of arms control.

Why not just stop AI development permanently? Because it’s gone too far in any case. Not just running models at a given level of capacity, but even training models at a given level of capacity becomes cheaper each year. We need the first superintelligent AI created to be a safe. Neither washing our hands of AI development — leaving it to less responsible actors — nor racing ahead is the optimal strategy here.

The problem is that AI 2040 is politically naive, and it focuses only on extinction risk. To prevent oligarchic takeover, the plan needs to be supplemented by democracy strengthened beyond all recognition. Frankly, even if we put aside the issue of oligarchy, public organisation is almost certainly required. The political system is too sclerotic to act on its own.

There’s a second reason the plan needs to be supplemented by a democratic upswell. It creates a vast centralisation of computing power in government hands. This perhaps lowers the chance of the oligarchical scenario if the oligarchs are private. However, it raises the chance of permanently empowering political elites. More democracy is the only antidote I know.

Thus, we need to achieve power through mass action. I very much doubt voting alone will be enough. There are many models here. The Carnation Revolution is one, but I suspect something more like the 2008–09 Icelandic financial crisis protests (the “Kitchenware Revolution”) is the model. A mass efflorescence of activity in response to a sense that elites are trying to steal the farm, aimed both at greater democracy and very concrete goals. Transformation of the public sphere.

But we don’t live in a politically active era! Well, I’m not sure that’s true even now, but it certainly won’t be after the job losses start in earnest. Tens of millions in America alone losing not just their current job, but all possibility of work in a field they are qualified for, forever. That will smash polarisation and build a populace united in anger if anything can. The key thing will be to stop attempts to turn white-collar and blue-collar workers against each other; automation of one will follow the other. Likewise, attempts at deflecting political momentum to status-quo-preserving formations, like fascism, must be opposed.

The idea that we need to transform the public sphere may sound quite radical, but I would look at it this way. More-than-humanly intelligent entities under the control of humans will tend to lock in the power of whoever has final control over them when they are created. Thus we must all, collectively, have that power. I do not think politics as it stands is up to the task.

The immediate steps are to:

1. Learn as much as you can.

2. Raise the issue as widely as you can.

3. Begin to organise — in your workplace and community — around the issue. Join organisations or found them. Bring others along.

Things will be slow at first. As the job losses begin it will get much faster.

I’m aware that “achieve power through mass action” is a big ask, but I’ve never been a quitter. I’m not being flippant, and there will be a golden hour for exactly this kind of action once the proverbial hits the proverbial. It is a golden hour because it closes. Workers, faced with losing everything, will become stronger, more determined, more capable of organising. Then, as economic and military functions are automated, they will get weaker unless they have locked in control by that point.

Half of the battle is simply in acting like people who want to win, not merely vent. The struggle is winnable. Elites will be divided; the people will be united in anger. We just need collective will.
