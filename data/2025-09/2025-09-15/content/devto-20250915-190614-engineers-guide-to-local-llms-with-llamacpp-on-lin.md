# Introduction

In this write up I will share my local AI setup on Ubuntu that I use for my personal projects as well as professional workflows (local chat, agentic workflows, coding agents, data analysis, synthetic dataset generation, etc).

This setup is particularly useful when I want to generate large amounts of synthetic datasets locally, process large amounts of sensitive data with LLMs in a safe way, use local agents without sending my private data to third party LLM providers, or just use chat/RAGs in complete privacy.

## What you'll learn

* CompileLlamaCPPon your machine, set it up in your PATH, keep it up to date (compiling from source allows to use the bleeding edge version of llamacpp so you can always get latest features as soon as they are merged into the master branch)
* Use llama-server to serve local models with very fast inference speeds
* Setup llama-swap to automate model swapping on the fly and use it as your OpenAI compatible API endpoint.
* Use systemd to setup llama-swap as a service that boots with your system and automatically restarts when the server config file changes
* Integrate local AI in Agent Mode into your terminal withQwenCode/OpenCode

I will also share what models I use for different types of workflows and different advanced configurations for each model (context expansion, parallel batch inference, multi modality, embedding, rereanking, and more.

This will be a technical write up, and I will skip some things like installing and configuring basic build tools,CUDA toolkit installation, git, etc, if I do miss some steps that where not obvious to setup, or something doesn't work from your end, please let me know in the comments, I will gladly help you out, and progressively update the article with new information and more details as more people complain about specific aspects of the setup process.

### Hardware

* RTX3090 Founders Edition 24GB VRAM

The more VRAM you have the larger models you can load, but if you don't have the same GPU as long at it's an NVIDIA GPU it's fine, you can still load smaller models, just don't expect good agentic and tool usage results from smaller LLMs.

RTX3090 can load a Q5 quantized 30B Qwen3 model entirely into VRAM, with up to 140t/s as inference speed and 24k tokens context window (or up 110K tokens with some flash attention magic)

## Prerequisites

* Experience with working on a Linux Dev Box
* Ubuntu 24 or 25
* NVIDIA proprietary drivers installed (version 580 at the time of writing)
* CUDA toolking installed
* Linux build tools + Git installed and configured

# Architecture

Here is a rough overview of the architecture we will be setting up:

# Installing and setting up Llamacpp

LlamaCpp is a very fast and flexible inference engine, it will allow us to run LLMs in GGUF format locally.

Clone the repo:

git clone git@github.com:ggml-org/llama.cpp.git

Enter fullscreen mode

Exit fullscreen mode

cd into the repo:

cd
llama.cpp

Enter fullscreen mode

Exit fullscreen mode

compile llamacpp for CUDA:

cmake
-B
 build
-DGGML_CUDA
=
ON
-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS
=
OFF
-DLLAMA_CURL
=
ON
-DGGML_CUDA_FA_ALL_QUANTS
=
ON

Enter fullscreen mode

Exit fullscreen mode

If you have a different GPU, checkout the build guidehere

cmake
--build
 build
--config
 Release
-j

--clean-first

Enter fullscreen mode

Exit fullscreen mode

This will create llama.cpp binaries inbuild/binfolder.

To update llamacpp to bleeding edge just pull the lastes changes from the master branch withgit pull origin masterand run the same commands to recompile

## Add llamacpp to PATH

Depending on your shell, add the following to you bashrc or zshrc config file so we can execute llamacpp binaries in the terminal

export LLAMACPP=[PATH TO CLONED LLAMACPP FOLDER]
export PATH=$LLAMACPP/build/bin:$PATH

Enter fullscreen mode

Exit fullscreen mode

Test that everything works correctly:

llama-server
--help

Enter fullscreen mode

Exit fullscreen mode

The output should look like this:

Test that inference is working correctly:

llama-cli
-hf
 ggml-org/gemma-3-1b-it-GGUF

Enter fullscreen mode

Exit fullscreen mode

Great! now that we can do inference, let move on to setting up llama swap

# Installing and setting up llama swap

llama-swapis a light weight, proxy server that provides automatic model swapping to llama.cpp's server. It will automate the model loading and unloading through a special configuration file and provide us with an openai compatible REST API endpoint.

## Download and install

Download the latest version from the releases page:

* https://github.com/mostlygeek/llama-swap/releases

(look forllama-swap_159_linux_amd64.tar.gz)

Unzip the downloaded archive and put thellama-swapexecutable somewhere in your home folder (eg:~/llama-swap/bin/llama-swap)

Add it to your path :

export PATH=$HOME/llama-swap/bin:$PATH

Enter fullscreen mode

Exit fullscreen mode

create an empty (for now) config file file in~/llama-swap/config.yaml

test the executable

llama-swap --help

Before setting up llama-swap configuration we first need to download a few GGUF models .

To get started, let's download qwen3-4b and gemma gemma3-4b

* https://huggingface.co/ggml-org/Qwen3-4B-GGUF/blob/main/Qwen3-4B-Q8_0.gguf
* https://huggingface.co/ggml-org/gemma-3-4b-it-GGUF/blob/main/gemma-3-4b-it-Q8_0.gguf

Download and put the GGUF files in the following folder structure

~/models
├── google
│   └── Gemma3-4B
│   └── Qwen3-4B-Q8_0.gguf
└── qwen
 └── Qwen3-4B
    └── gemma-3-4b-it-Q8_0.gguf

Enter fullscreen mode

Exit fullscreen mode

Now that we have some ggufs, let's create a llama-swap config file.

## Llama Swap config file

Our llama swap config located in~/llama-swap/config.yamlwill look like this:

macros
:


"
Qwen3-4b-macro"
:

>


llama-server \


--port ${PORT} \


-ngl 80 \


--ctx-size 8000 \


--temp 0.7 \


--top-p 0.8 \


--top-k 20 \


--min-p 0 \


--repeat-penalty 1.05 \


--no-webui \


--timeout 300 \


--flash-attn on \


--jinja \


--alias Qwen3-4b \


-m /home/[YOUR HOME FOLDER]/models/qwen/Qwen3-4B/Qwen3-4B-Q8_0.gguf


"
Gemma-3-4b-macro"
:

>


llama-server \


--port ${PORT} \


-ngl 80 \


--top-p 0.95 \


--top-k 64 \


--no-webui \


--timeout 300 \


--flash-attn on \


-m /home/[YOUR HOME FOLDER]/models/google/Gemma3-4B/gemma-3-4b-it-Q8_0.gguf

models
:


"
Qwen3-4b"
:

# <-- this is your model ID when calling the REST API


cmd
:

|


${Qwen3-4b-macro}


ttl
:

3600


"
Gemma3-4b"
:


cmd
:

|


${Gemma-3-4b-macro}


ttl
:

3600

Enter fullscreen mode

Exit fullscreen mode

## Start llama-swap

Now we can start llama-swap with the following command:

llama-swap
--listen
 0.0.0.0:8083
--config
 ~/llama-swap/config.yaml

Enter fullscreen mode

Exit fullscreen mode

You can access llama-swap UI at:http://localhost:8083

Here you can see all configured models, you can also load or unload them manually.

## Inference

Let's do some inference via llama-swap REST API completions endpoint

Calling Qwen3:

curl
-X
 POST http://localhost:8083/v1/chat/completions
\

-H

"Content-Type: application/json"

\

-d

'{
 "messages": [
 {
 "role": "user",
 "content": "hello"
 }
 ],
 "stream": false,
 "model": "Qwen3-4b"
}'
 | jq

Enter fullscreen mode

Exit fullscreen mode

Calling Gemma3:

curl
-X
 POST http://localhost:8083/v1/chat/completions
\

-H

"Content-Type: application/json"

\

-d

'{
 "messages": [
 {
 "role": "user",
 "content": "hello"
 }
 ],
 "stream": false,
 "model": "Gemma3-4b"
}'
 | jq

Enter fullscreen mode

Exit fullscreen mode

You should see a response from the server that looks something like this, and llamaswap will automatically load the correct model into the memory with each request:


"choices"
:

[


{


"finish_reason"
:

"stop"
,


"index"

}


}

}

}

Exit fullscreen mode

## Optional: Adding llamaswap as systemd service and setup auto restart when config file changes

If you don't want to manually run the llama-swap command everytime you turn on your workstation or manually reload the llama-swap server when you change your config you can leverage systemd to automate that away, create the following files:

Llamaswap service unit (if you are not using zsh adapt theExecStartaccordingly)

~/.config/systemd/user/llama-swap.service:

[Unit]
Description=Llama Swap Server
After=multi-user.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/bin/zsh -l -c "source ~/.zshrc && llama-swap --listen 0.0.0.0:8083 --config ~/llama-swap/config.yaml"
WorkingDirectory=%h
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal
Restart=always
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

Enter fullscreen mode

Exit fullscreen mode

Llamaswap restart service unit

~/.config/systemd/user/llama-swap-restart.service:

[Unit]
Description=Restart llama-swap service
After=llama-swap.service

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/bin/systemctl --user restart llama-swap.service

Enter fullscreen mode

Exit fullscreen mode

Llamaswap path unit (will allow to monitor changes in the llama-swap config file and call the restart service whenever the changes are detected):

~/.config/systemd/user/llama-swap-config.path

[Unit]
Description=Monitor llamaswap config file for changes
After=multi-user.target

[Path]
# Monitor the specific file for modifications
PathModified=%h/llama-swap/config.yaml
Unit=llama-swap-restart.service

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target

Enter fullscreen mode

Exit fullscreen mode

Enable and start the units:

sudo
systemctl daemon-reload

Enter fullscreen mode

Exit fullscreen mode

systemctl
--user

enable
llama-swap-restart.service llama-swap.service llama-swap-config.path

Enter fullscreen mode

Exit fullscreen mode

systemctl
--user
 start llama-swap.service

Enter fullscreen mode

Exit fullscreen mode

Check that the service is running correctly:

systemctl
--user
 status llama-swap.service

Enter fullscreen mode

Exit fullscreen mode

Monitor llamaswap server logs:

journalctl
--user

-u
 llama-swap.service
-f

Enter fullscreen mode

Exit fullscreen mode

Whenever the llama swap config is updated, the llamawap proxy server will automatically restart, you can verify it by monitoring the logs and making an update to the config file.

If were able to get this far, congrats, you can start downloading and configuring your own models and setting up your own config, you can draw some inspiration from my config available here:https://gist.github.com/avatsaev/dc302228e6628b3099cbafab80ec8998

It contains some advanced configurations, like multi-modal inference, parallel inference on the same model, extending context length with flash attention and more

# Connecting QwenCode to local models

InstallQwenCodeAnd let's use it withQwen3 Coder 30B Instructlocally (I recommend having at least 24GB of VRAM for this one 😅)

Here is my llama swap config:

macros
:

--repeat-penalty 1.05 \


--cache-type-k q8_0 \


--cache-type-v q8_0 \

Exit fullscreen mode

I'm usingUnsloth's Dynamic quantsat Q4 with flash attention and extending the context window to 100k tokens (with --cache-type-k and --cache-type-v flags), this is right at the edge of 24GBs of vram of my RTX3090.

You can download qwen coder ggufshere

For a test scenario let's create a very simple react app in typescript

Create an empty project folder~/qwen-code-testInside this folder create an.envfile with the following contents:

OPENAI_API_KEY
=
"qwen"

OPENAI_BASE_URL
=
"http://localhost:8083/v1"

OPENAI_MODEL
=
"Qwen3-coder"

Enter fullscreen mode

Exit fullscreen mode

cd into the test directory and start qwen code:

cd ~/qwen-code-test
qwen

Enter fullscreen mode

Exit fullscreen mode

make sure that the model is correctly set from your .env file:

I've installedQwen Code Companion extenstionin VS Code, and here are the results, a fully local coding agent running in VS Code 😁
