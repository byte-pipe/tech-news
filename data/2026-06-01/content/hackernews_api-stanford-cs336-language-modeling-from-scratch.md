### What is this course about?

Language models serve as the cornerstone of modern natural language
 processing (NLP) applications and open up a new paradigm of having a
 single general purpose system address a range of downstream tasks. As
 the field of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and
 NLP continues to grow, possessing a deep understanding of language
 models becomes essential for scientists and engineers alike. This course
 is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of
 language models by walking them through the entire process of developing
 their own. Drawing inspiration from operating systems courses that
 create an entire operating system from scratch, we will lead students
 through every aspect of language model creation, including data
 collection and cleaning for pre-training, transformer model
 construction, model training, and evaluation before deployment.

### Prerequisites

* Proficiency in PythonThe majority of class assignments will be in Python. Unlike most
 other AI classes, students will be given minimal scaffolding. The
 amount of code you will write will be at least an order of magnitude
 greater than for other classes. Therefore, being proficient in
 Python and software engineering is paramount.
* Experience with deep learning and systems optimizationA significant part of the course will involve making neural language
 models run quickly and efficiently on GPUs across multiple machines.
 We expect students to be able to have a strong familiarity with
 PyTorch and know basic systems concepts like the memory hierarchy.
* College Calculus, Linear Algebra(e.g. MATH 51, CME 100)You should be comfortable understanding matrix/vector notation and
 operations.
* Basic Probability and Statistics(e.g. CS 109 or equivalent)You should know the basics of probabilities, Gaussian distributions,
 mean, standard deviation, etc.
* Machine Learning(e.g. CS221, CS229, CS230, CS124, CS224N)You should be comfortable with the basics of machine learning and
 deep learning.

Note that this is a 5-unit class. This is a very implementation-heavy
 class, so please allocate enough time for it.

### GPU compute for self-study

If you are following along at home, you can access GPU compute from a cloud provider to complete the assignments.

Here are a few options (public pricing for a single B200 GPU on March 28, 2026):

* Modal(sponsor):$6.25/hour. Offers $30 of free monthly compute. You are only charged for actual compute (no idle resources) and their UX makes switching between local dev and
 large-scale gpu experiments simple. (Modal Pricing)
* Lambda Labs:$6.69/hour(Lambda Pricing)
* RunPod:$4.99/hour(RunPod Pricing)
* Nebius:$5.50/hour($3.05/hour preemptible) (Nebius Pricing)
* Together:$7.49/hour, minimum 8 GPUs, cheaper for longer commitments (Together Pricing)

For convenience and to save money, we recommend debugging correctness of your implementation on CPU first and then using GPU(s)
 (with the count recommended in the assignments) for completing training runs (A1, A4, A5) or benchmarking GPU operations (A2).

### Honor code

 Like all other classes at Stanford, we take the student
 
Honor Code

 seriously. Please respect the following policies:
 
* Collaboration: Study groups are allowed, but students must
 understand and complete their own assignments, and hand in one
 assignment per student. If you worked in a group, please put the
 names of the members of your study group at the top of your
 assignment. Please ask if you have any questions about the
 collaboration policy.
* AI tools: Prompting LLMs such as ChatGPT is permitted for
 low-level programming questions or high-level conceptual questions
 about language models, but using it directly to solve the problem is
 prohibited. We strongly encourage you to disable AI autocomplete
 (e.g., Cursor Tab, GitHub CoPilot) in your IDE when completing
 assignments (though non-AI autocomplete, e.g., autocompleting
 function names is totally fine). We have found that AI autocomplete
 makes it much harder to engage deeply with the content. See theAI policy(inspired bythis).
* Existing code: Implementations for many of the things you
 will implement exist online. The handouts we'll give will be
 self-contained, so that you will not need to consult third-party
 code for producing your own implementation. Thus, you should not
 look at any existing code unless when otherwise specified in the
 handouts.

### Submitting coursework

* All coursework are submitted via Gradescope by the deadline. Do not
 submit your coursework via email.
* If anything goes wrong, please ask a question in Slack or contact a
 course assistant.
* You can submit as many times as you'd like until the deadline: we
 will only grade the last submission.
* Partial work is better than not submitting any work.

### Late days

* Each student has6 late days to use. A late day extends the
 deadline by 24 hours.
* You can use up to 3 late days per assignment.

### Regrade requests

If you believe that the course staff made an objective error in
 grading, you may submit a regrade request on Gradescope within 3 days
 after the grades are released.

### Sponsor

We would like to thankModalfor sponsoring compute for this class.
