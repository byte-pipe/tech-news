# 10 features of D that I love



This is a beginner-friendly post exploring some of my favourite parts of theD programming language, ranging from smaller quality of life stuff, to more major features.

Iwon’ttalk much about D’s metaprogramming in this post as that topic basically requires its own dedicated feature list, but I still want to mention that D’s metaprogramming is world class - allowing a level of flexibility & modelling power that few statically compiled languages are able to rival.

I’ll be providing some minimal code snippets to demonstrate each feature, but this is by no means an in depth technical post, but more of an easy to read “huh, that’s neat/absolutely abhorrent!” sort of deal.

## Summary

* Feature - Automatic constructors
* Feature - Design by contract
* Syntax - The dollar operator
* Feature - CTFE (Compile Time Function Execution)
* Feature - Built-in unittests
* Feature - Exhaustive switch statements
* Syntax - Parenthesis omission
* Syntax - UFCS (Uniform Function Call Syntax)
* Feature - Scoped & Selective Imports
* Feature - Built-in documentation generator
* Conclusion

## Feature - Automatic constructors

If you define a struct (by-value object) without an explicit constructor, the compiler will automatically generate one for you based on the lexical order of the struct’s fields.

struct

Vector2
{

int

a
;

int

b
;


/++ Automatically generates this constructor:


this(int a = int.init, int b = int.init)

{

this.a = a;

this.b = b;

}


++/
}

void

main
()
{

const

noParams

=

Vector2
();

const

oneParam

=

Vector2
(
20
);
// Sets .a to `20`

const

twoParams

=

Vector2
(
20
,

40
);
// Sets .a to `20` and .b to `40`
}

Very handy for Plain Old Data types, especially with the semi-recent support fornamed parameters.

## Feature - Design by contract

D supportscontract programmingwhich allows functions to define:

* “in” assertions to confirm that the function’s parameters are valid.
* “out” assertions to confirm that the function’s return value is in a valid state.

Additionally you can attach “invariants” onto structs and classes. Invariants are functions that run at the start and end of everypublicmember function, and can be used to ensure that the type is always in a valid state.

Let’s start off with a contrived example of invariants:

// Example of invariants
struct

PositiveBound
{

private

{

int

_lower
;

int

_upper
;


// Arbitrary function syntax

invariant

{

assert(
_lower

>=

0
,

"_lower must not be negative"
)
;

assert(
_upper

>=

0
,

"_upper must not be negative"
)
;

}


// Short hand syntax, translates to a single `assert()`.

invariant
(
_upper

>=

_lower
,

"_upper must not be less than _lower"
);

}


this
(
int

lower
,

int

upper
)

{

// invariants don't run at the start of constructors.


this
._lower

=

lower
;

this
._upper

=

upper
;


// invariants are called.

}


void

upper
(
int

upper
)

{

// invariants are called.


this
._upper

=

upper
;


// invariants are called again.

}


private

void

setLower
(
int

lower
)

{

// Function is non-public, invariants aren't called.

this
._lower

=

lower
;

}
}

Now let’s rewrite the above type to use “in” contracts instead, with an extra function to show off “out” contracts:

// Example of in/out contracts
struct

PositiveBound
{

private

{

int

_lower
;

int

_upper
;

}


this
(
int

lower
,

int

upper
)

in
(
lower

>=

0
,

"lower must not be negative"
)

in
(
upper

>=

lower
,

"upper must not be less than lower"
)

{

// `in` functions are called.

this
._lower

=

lower
;

this
._upper

=

upper
;

}


void

upper
(
int

upper
)

in
(
upper

>=

this
._lower
,

"upper must not be less than lower"
)

{

this
._upper

=

upper
;

}


private

void

setLower
(
int

lower
)

in
(
lower

>=

0
,

"lower must not be negative"
)

{

this
._lower

=

lower
;

}


int

numbersInRange
()

out(
result
;
result
 >=
0
, "
result

is

somehow

negative
?"
)

out(
result
;
this._upper
 ==
this._lower
 ||
result
 !=
0
, "
upper

and

lower

are

different

numbers
,
but

result

is

somehow

0
?"
)

{

return

this
._upper

-

this
._lower
;
// `out` functions are called, with (this._upper - this._lower) as their parameter.

}
}

This can allow for an easy self-descriptive validation pattern for consumers/readers of your code, as well as an easy to implement self-checking mechanism for types that have complex internals.

Anecdotally I find this to be an underutilised feature of D, and it’s one I like to make use of a lot in my own code.

## Syntax - The dollar operator

A lot of languages do not provide a shorthand syntax for referencing the length of an array, which can sometimes lead to awkward looking code when e.g. slicing arrays (any Go enjoyers here?).

D provides the dollar operator, which is a shorthand syntax for referencing the length of something.

auto

foo

=
 [
0
,

1
,

2
,

3
,

4
,

5
,

6
,

7
,

8
,

9
,

10
];
auto

bar

=

foo
[
5
..$-
2
];
// Same as: foo[5..foo.length-2]

Structs and classes can evenoverloadthis operator.

## Feature - CTFE (Compile Time Function Execution)

D compilers provide an interpreter for the language which allows a very large amount of D code to be ran at compile time, as-is, without any special marking or other weirdness to go with it.

Generally, anywhere where the language requires a compile-time constant is a place where CTFE will transparently come into play.

import

std.algorithm
 :
filter
;
import

std.array
 :
array
;
import

std.range
 :
iota
;

// As we're setting a global variable, the value must be a compile-time constant.
//
// Due to CTFE, we can just use normal D functions to compute a value for us.
immutable

ALL_EVEN_NUMBERS_UNDER_1000

=

iota
(
0
,

1000
).
filter
!(
n
 =>
n

%

2

==

0
).
array
;

// pragma(msg) can write to stdout during compile time, thus requiring a compile-time constant.
// We can use this to confirm that everything is only happening during compilation.
pragma(msg,
ALL_EVEN_NUMBERS_UNDER_1000
)
;
// [0, 2, 4, 8, ...

This feature has a lot of different practical applications, and can allow for much cleaner, robust code than hardcoding precomputed values.

Since a lot of use cases relate to metaprogramming I’ll leave the topic here, but CTFE is an extremely instant example of D’s unusual feature set.

## Feature - Built-in unittests

D has direct support for defining unittests, and even allows you to override the built-in test runner for something more robust (such as with theunit-threadedlibrary).

D code usually bundles unittests and normal code within the same file, rather than splitting them out into separate files as with most other languages:

int

add
(
int

a
,

int

b
)
=>

a

+

b
;
unittest
{

assert(
add
(
60

+

8
)
==

68
,

"60 + 8 is somehow not equal to 68"
)
;
}

// If you give a unittest an empty documentation comment (`///`), then D's built in documentation
// generator will generate an "example" block using the test code!

int

sub
(
int

a
,

int

b
)
=>

a

-

b
;
///
unittest
{

assert(
sub
(
70
,

2
)
==

68
)
;
}

This extremely low-friction barrier for writing tests is a godsend for motivating people to write even the most minimal of tests.

Of course if you have more complex needs then the option to have a proper testing framework + structure is still available to you, but the vast majority of D code I’ve seen simply usesunittestblocks, optionally with a library that provides a better test runner.

## Feature - Exhaustive switch statements

D provides afinal switchstatement which has an autogenerateddefault:case that will immediately crash the program if its taken.

This allows you to define a switch that will always alert you if a new value needs to be added, or if an invalid value was somehow passed into it.

Additionally, if you use afinal switchwith anenumvalue, then a compile-time check is triggered to ensure that every value within theenumtype has been declared, making it impossible to forget to add a new case when the enum is modified.

enum

OutputType
{

file
,

stdout
}

void

main
()
{

auto

output

=

OutputType.stdout
;


// Exhaustive switching with a compile time check.

final switch
(
output
)

{

case

OutputType.file
:

// ...

break
;


case

OutputType.stdout
:

// ...

break
;

}


// Exhausitve switching with no compile time check, may trigger a `SwitchError` at runtime.

auto

str

=

"not my string"
;

final switch
(
str
)

{

case

"my string"
:

// ...

break
;


// Any other value will crash the program (unless the SwitchError is caught, which you shouldn't do outside of tests).

}
}

## Syntax - Parenthesis omission

D allows you to omit parentheses when calling functions in multiple contexts.

When calling a function with no parameters, you can omit them:

struct

Person
{

private

string

_name
;


string

name
()
=>

this
._name
;
}

void

main
()
{

import

std.stdio
 :
writeln
;


auto

person

=

Person
(
"Brad"
);

writeln
(
person.name
);
// Instead of: writeln(person.name())
}

(Marginally related) When calling a function with 1 parameter, you may use assignment syntax instead:

struct

Person
{

private

string

_name
;


void

name
(
string

name
)

{

this
._name

=

name
;

}
}

void

main
()
{

Person

person
;

person.name

=

"Brad"
;
// Instead of: person.name("Brad")
}

When passing a single template parameter which consists of only 1 lexical token, you may omit the parenthesis:

import

std.conv
 :
to
;

void

main
()
{

auto

number

=

"20"
.
to
!int
;
// Instead of "20.to!(int)" or "20.to!(int)()"
}

This can do wonders for readability.

## Syntax - UFCS (Uniform Function Call Syntax)

UFCS allows call chains to be “inverted” by allowing freestanding functions to be used as if they were a member of their first parameter.

In other words:baz(bar(foo))can be rewritten asfoo.bar().baz().

The two following snippets are completely equivalent in function, except the second snippet uses UFCS to provide a more clean look.

import

std.algorithm
 :
filter
,

map
;
import

std.range
 :
iota
;
import

std.stdio
 :
writeln
;

// Without UFCS
void

main
()
{

writeln
(
map
!
(
num
 =>
num

*

2
)(

filter
!
(
num
 =>
num

%

2

==

0
)(

iota
(
0
,

10_000
)

)

));
}

import

std.algorithm
 :
filter
,

map
;
import

std.range
 :
iota
;
import

std.stdio
 :
writeln
;

// With UFCS
void

main
()
{

iota
(
0
,

10_000
)

.
filter
!(
num
 =>
num

%

2

==

0
)

.
map
!(
num
 =>
num

*

2
)

.writeln
();
}

## Feature - Scoped & Selective Imports

D supports limiting imports to a specific scope, whether that be a singular if-statement, an entire function, an entire struct/class, etc.

D will also allow you to selectively import symbols from other modules, instead of polluting your lookup scope with a ton of unrelated stuff - also helps increase comprehension of the codebase.

// (slightly contrived example)

import

std.algorithm
 :
joiner
;
// Scoped to the entire module.

struct

Person
{

import

std.algorithm
 :
filter
;
// Scoped to everything in this struct.


string
[]
names
;


void

printNames
()

{

import

std.stdio
 :
write
,

writeln
;
// Scoped only to this function.


if
(
this
.names.length

>

1
)

{

import

std.algorithm
 :
each
;
// Scoped only to this branch.

this
.names.filter
!(
name
 =>
name.length

>

0
)

.joiner
(
" "
)

.
each
!
write
;

writeln
();

}

else

writeln
(
this
.names
[
0
]);

}
}

void

main
()
{

Person
([
"Bradley"
,

"Chatha"
])
.printNames
();

Person
([
"Shmradley"
])
.printNames
();
}

While it may seem like clutter and extra effort, in the long run this allows for:

1. Making it easy for newcomers to understand where certain functions are coming from.
2. Allows for code to become “portable” between files since the code can carry most of its external dependencies inside of itself, making refactoring a bit easier.

## Feature - Built-in documentation generator

Finally, D has a built-in documentation generator with a relative standard, easy to read format.

There’s also a handful of documentation tools that are detached from the built-in one since the default generated output is a bit lacklustre (coughI’m plugging mycustom toolhere).

Here’s a relatively extreme example from one of my personal projects, to get an idea of the basic format:

/++

+ Parses a URI from a string into a `ScopeUri`, which specifically does not contain any copy of the input

+ data, but instead slices from the original `input` slice.

+

+ This means the returned `ScopeUri` is only valid for as long as the `input` slice is valid and unmodified.

+

+ This function is intended to be used when the caller wants to avoid copying the input data, and is willing

+ to accept the limitations and risks of a `ScopeUri`.

+

+ Please report any non-compliance with RFC 3986 as a bug.

+

+ Valid Formats:

+ isAbsolute

+ -> scheme://user:info@host:port/path?query#fragment, e.g. "http://user:info@localhost:8080/some/path?some=query#some-fragment"

+

+ isNetworkReference

+ -> //user:info@host:port/path?query#fragment, e.g. "//user:info@localhost:8080/some/path?some=query#some-fragment"

+

+ !isAbsolute && !isNetworkReference && pathIsAbsolute

+ -> /path?query#fragment, e.g. "/some/path?some=query#some-fragment"

+

+ pathIsRootless

+ only if `UriParseRules.allowUriSuffix` IS NOT set.

+ -> path?query#fragment, e.g. "some/path?some=query#some-fragment"

+

+ isUriSuffix

+ only the host component is supported within the authority - port and user info are not supported

+ due to their colons causing the URI to be seen as an absolute URI, which will likely generate an error.

+ only if `UriParseRules.allowUriSuffix` IS set.

+ -> host/path?query#fragment, e.g. "localhost/some/path?some=query#some-fragment"

+

+ Please see the individual, lower level parsing functions for the exact details of each component.

+

+ Notes:

+ The output of all `out` parameters is undefined if the function returns an error.

+

+ This parser will attempt to heuristically determine whether the start of the URI

+ is a scheme or an authority. Please note that errors in a scheme may manifest as an error in the

+ authority component.

+

+ If it's not clear, you can use `uri.hints` to determine the exact structure of the URI.

+

+ Params:

+ input = The input string to parse

+ uri = The `ScopeUri` to write the parsed URI to

+ rules = A set of rules that can be used to control the behaviour of the URI parser

+

+ Throws:

+ Anything that `uriParseScheme`, `uriParseAuthority`, `uriParsePath`, `uriParseQuery`, or `uriParseFragment` can throw.

+

+ Returns:

+ A `Result` indicating whether the parsing was successful or not.

)

}

Here’s an example from the standard library, which has minor usage of documentation macros:

/**
Converts a hex literal to a string at compile time.

Takes a string made of hexadecimal digits and returns
the matching string by converting each pair of digits to a character.
The input string can also include white characters, which can be used
to keep the literal string readable in the source code.

The function is intended to replace the hexadecimal literal strings
starting with `'x'`, which could be removed to simplify the core language.

Params:

hexData = string to be converted.

Returns:

a `string`, a `wstring` or a `dstring`, according to the type of hexData.

See_Also:

Use $(REF fromHexString, std, digest) for run time conversions.

Note, these functions are not drop-in replacements and have different

input requirements.

This template inherits its data syntax from builtin

$(LINK2 $(ROOT_DIR)spec/lex.html#hex_string, hex strings).

See $(REF fromHexString, std, digest) for its own respective requirements.

## Conclusion

I tried to focus more on the more simpler day-to-day features, with only a splattering of the bigger more complicated stuff.

Hopefully this provides some insight on the wacky-yet-wonderful feature set that D provides.
