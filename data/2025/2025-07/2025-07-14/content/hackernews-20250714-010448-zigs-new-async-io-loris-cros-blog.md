# Zig's New Async I/O

July 13, 2025•13min read • byLoris Cro

Asynchronicity is not concurrency.

In theZig Roadmap 2026stream Andrew announced a new way of doing I/O, let’s see what are the goals of this upcoming design and how that relates to the revival of async / await in Zig.

## The new I/O Interface

The most notable change to Zig is the introduction of a new interface in charge of all I/O operations. Most importantly, theIointerface is now expected to be provided by the caller, just like we already do withAllocator.

Old Zig:

const

std

=

@import
(
"std"
)
;

fn

saveData
(
data
:

[
]
const

u8
)

!
void

{


const

file

=

try

std
.
fs
.
cwd
(
)
.
createFile
(
"save.txt"
,

.
{
}
)
;


defer

file
.
close
(
)
;


try

file
.
writeAll
(
data
)
;


const

out

=

std
.
io
.
getStdOut
(
)
;


try

out
.
writeAll
(
"save complete"
)
;

}

New Zig:

const

std

=

@import
(
"std"
)
;

const

Io

=

std
.
Io
;

fn

saveData
(
io
:

Io
,

data
:

[
]
const

u8
)

!
void

{


const

file

=

try

Io
.
Dir
.
cwd
(
)
.
createFile
(
io
,

"save.txt"
,

.
{
}
)
;


defer

file
.
close
(
io
)
;


try

file
.
writeAll
(
io
,

data
)
;


const

out
:

Io
.
File

=

.
stdout
(
)
;


try

out
.
writeAll
(
io
,

"save complete"
)
;

}

The main implication of this change is that now the author of a program is able to decide the concrete I/O implementation and inject it also into code coming from dependencies.

TheIointerface is also in charge of concurrency operations as those can intertwine with I/O, especially in the case of event loops. If a piece of code properly expressesconcurrencyof operations, then theIoimplementation will have the opportunity of introducingparallelism.

To show this concept using a code example, let’s imagine that to save our data we now need to write to two different files.

This is an implementation that does not express concurrency and thus will not be able to leverage any potential parallelism offered by theIoimplementation:

const

std

=

@import
(
"std"
)
;

const

Io

=

std
.
Io
;

fn

saveData
(
io
:

Io
,

data
:

[
]
const

u8
)

!
void

{


try

saveFile
(
io
,

data
,

"saveA.txt"
)
;


try

saveFile
(
io
,

data
,

"saveB.txt"
)
;


const

out
:

Io
.
File

=

.
stdout
(
)
;


try

out
.
writeAll
(
io
,

"save complete"
)
;

}

fn

saveFile
(
io
:

Io
,

data
:

[
]
const

u8
,

name
:

[
]
const

u8
)

!
void

{


const

file

=

try

Io
.
Dir
.
cwd
(
)
.
createFile
(
io
,

name
,

.
{
}
)
;


defer

file
.
close
(
io
)
;


try

file
.
writeAll
(
io
,

data
)
;

}

Although this implementation does not express concurrency, simply by operating on the Io interface, it already participates properly in an event loop with respect to blocking/non-blocking, should that be the chosen Io implementation of the application.

This version instead properly encodes that there is no required order when writing to the two files:

const

std

=

@import
(
"std"
)
;

const

Io

=

std
.
Io
;

fn

saveData
(
io
:

Io
,

data
:

[
]
const

u8
)

!
void

{


var

a_future

=

io
.
async
(
saveFile
,

.
{
io
,

data
,

"saveA.txt"
}
)
;


var

b_future

=

io
.
async
(
saveFile
,

.
{
io
,

data
,

"saveB.txt"
}
)
;


const

a_result

=

a_future
.
await
(
io
)
;


const

b_result

=

b_future
.
await
(
io
)
;


try

a_result
;


try

b_result
;


const

out
:

Io
.
File

=

.
stdout
(
)
;


try

out
.
writeAll
(
io
,

"save complete"
)
;

}

fn

saveFile
(
io
:

Io
,

data
:

[
]
const

u8
,

name
:

[
]
const

u8
)

!
void

{


const

file

=

try

Io
.
Dir
.
cwd
(
)
.
createFile
(
io
,

name
,

.
{
}
)
;


defer

file
.
close
(
io
)
;


try

file
.
writeAll
(
io
,

data
)
;

}

Most notably, this second version will not only work better when run over an evented I/O implementation, but it will still be correct when used with blocking I/O becauseio.asyncwill immediately callsaveFile, andFuture.awaitwill become a no-op.

Another interesting detail of this second code example is that we had to useawaitandtryseparately, instead of being able to do everything at once, like so:

try

a_future
.
await
(
io
)
;

// error here -> early return

try

b_future
.
await
(
io
)
;

The reason why we can’t immediately usetryis because iftry a_future.await(io)were to trip, we would fail to awaitb_future. Futures are resources that need to be released so failing to await one is a programming error.

That said, this unfortunate use oftryis kinda our fault because we didn’t go the full length. Let’s see what happens when we introduce support for cancellation:

const

std

=

@import
(
"std"
)
;

const

Io

=

std
.
Io
;

fn

saveData
(
io
:

Io
,

data
:

[
]
const

u8
)

!
void

{


var

a_future

=

io
.
async
(
saveFile
,

.
{
io
,

data
,

"saveA.txt"
}
)
;


defer

a_future
.
cancel
(
io
)

catch

{
}
;


var

b_future

=

io
.
async
(
saveFile
,

.
{
io
,

data
,

"saveB.txt"
}
)
;


defer

b_future
.
cancel
(
io
)

catch

{
}
;


// We could decide to cancel the current task


// and everything would be realeased correctly.


// if (true) return error.Canceled;


try

a_future
.
await
(
io
)
;


try

b_future
.
await
(
io
)
;


const

out
:

Io
.
File

=

.
stdout
(
)
;


try

out
.
writeAll
(
io
,

"save complete"
)
;

}

fn

saveFile
(
io
:

Io
,

data
:

[
]
const

u8
,

name
:

[
]
const

u8
)

!
void

{


const

file

=

try

Io
.
Dir
.
cwd
(
)
.
createFile
(
io
,

name
,

.
{
}
)
;


defer

file
.
close
(
io
)
;


try

file
.
writeAll
(
io
,

data
)
;

}

The API ofFuture.cancel()is identical toFuture.await()aside from additionally requesting cancellation from theIoimplementation. Both functions are idempotent. Canceling an already completedFutureis the same as awaiting it, meaning any unwanted resources must be immediately deallocated. Incomplete canceled I/O operations returnerror.Canceled.

With this last code example we were able to implement support for cancellation without introducing nesting or any more complexity than necessary, and we regained the ability to usetrywhere it intuitively makes sense.

Let’s take a look now at how differentIoimplementations can perform async I/O.

## Stdlib I/O Implementations

Given thatIois an interface (in the runtime polymorphism sense of the word), you will be able to create your own or use ones implemented in a third party package, but the Zig standard library will offer a set of implementations for solving common use cases.

The most basic implementation ofIois one that maps to blocking I/O operations. This implementation will be present in the stdlib and is designed to generate machine code equivalent to using C (i.e. no extra machinery introduced in the executable, see later how that relates to virtual function calls).

What’s more interesting are all the implementations that include an event loop. Let’s take a look at what they will be, according to current plans.

### Thread pool

This implementation uses blocking I/O syscalls but multiplexes them over a pool of OS threads to introduce parallelism. This can be a nice stepping stone away from Single Threaded Blocking, but beware - it is tricky to manage the blocking operations optimally, particularly if any of them are networking clients!

### Green Threads

This implementation usesio_uringon Linux and similar APIs on other OSs for performing I/O combined with a thread pool. The key difference is that in this implementation OS threads will juggle multiple async tasks in the form of green threads.

This implementation requires having the ability to perform stack swapping on the target platform, meaning that it will not support WASM, for example.

The first prototype of this implementation supports x86_64 Linux. Support for other platforms will be added later. There are more interesting details about this implementation but I leave them to a future blog post.

### Stackless Coroutines

This implementation won’t be available immediately like the previous ones because it depends onreintroducinga special function calling convention and rewriting function bodies into state machines that don’t require an explicit stack to run.

This execution model is compatible with WASM and other platforms where stack swapping is not available or desireable.

## Design Goals

When async I/O was first attempted in Zig,asyncandawaitwere deeply tied to language-level support for stackless coroutines. This new direction decouples the two main concurrency primitives from the execution model. This, alongside other design choices, has a big impact in terms of code reusability and optimality.

### Code reusability

One of the main goals of Zig is to enable code reusability, which is always a touchy subject when it comes to async I/O.

The famous “What Color is Your Function?” blog post by Bob Nystrom explains very well the issues that come from the virality of async functions. In other languages it’s common to see a blocking and an async variant of the same thing (e.g. a database client), each maintained by different authors.

Zig has solved this problem since the beginning, as I previously explained in “What is Zig’s Colorblind Async / Await”. Thanks to Zig’s clever (and unorthodox) usage ofasyncandawait, a single library can work optimally in both synchronous and asynchronous mode, achieving the goal of code reusability, a property preserved with this new iteration of async I/O.

But this new approach pushes color blindness even further: previously thesourcecode would be free from the virality ofasync/await, but atruntimethe program was still forced to use stackless coroutines, which have a viral calling convention. Nowio.asyncandFuture.awaitcan be used with a variety of execution models, from blocking to stackless coroutines, fully freeing you from any form of virality.

With this last improvement Zig has completely defeated function coloring.

### Optimality

The newIointerface is non-generic and uses a vtable for dispatching function calls to a concrete implementation. This has the upside of reducing code bloat, but virtual calls do have a performance penalty at runtime. In release builds the optimizer can de-virtualize function calls but it’s not guaranteed.

A side effect of proposal#23367, which is needed for determining upper bound stack size, is guaranteed de-virtualization when there is only oneIoimplementation being used (also in debug builds!).

In the less common case when a program instantiates more than oneIoimplementation, virtual calls done through theIointerface will not be de-virtualized, as that would imply doubling the amount of machine code generated, creating massive code bloat.

One question that needed to be answered when designing theIointerface was where to perform buffering. In the old implementation buffering was offered by a concrete implementation of reader/writer. In the new version buffering is embedded in theReaderandWriterinterfaces instead.

Buffering at the interface level means that even when no de-virtualization can happen, you will have to go through a virtual call only to flush the buffer, ensuring optimal behavior even in such case.

#### Semantic I/O operations

The newWriterinterface features two new primitives for expressing specific operations in an optimized manner.

The first one is inspired by POSIXsendfile(and equivalents):

sendFile
:

*
const

fn

(


w
:

*
Writer
,


file_reader
:

*
File
.
Reader
,


limit
:

Limit
,

)

Operating systems have various syscalls for sending data from a file descriptor directly to another. The key insight here is that the data transfer happens in kernel space, without needing to copy bytes into your program’s memory, and then copy them again into the final file descriptor.

Being able to express this operation at theWriterinterface level will allow you to create chains of writers where, for example, sending a file over HTTP will still allow you to leveragesendfile.

The second one is the ability to perform vectorized writes plus support for splatting:

drain
:

*
const

fn

(


w
:

*
Writer
,


data
:

[
]
const

[
]
const

u8
,


splat
:

usize
,

)

Vectorized writes allow you to send in a single call multiple segments of data to be written. This operation can be expressed as a single POSIXwritevsyscall (or equivalents on other platforms).

Thesplatparameter defines how many times the last element ofdatashould be repeated. This can be useful for decompression streams for example, where sequences of zeros can be expressed as a single zero, repeatedsplattimes. This makes communication across a chain ofReaders more efficient, leaving to the finalWriter(the sink) the duty to turn a splat operation into concrete bytes.

## Roadmap

A small subset of these changes will be present in Zig 0.15.0 but you will have to wait until the subsequent release cycle before the rest of it makes into a tagged release, as a big part of the Zig standard library needs to be rewritten (and redesigned!) to make use of these new capabilities. Things like TLS encryption, HTTP server and client, etc.

## FAQ

### Zig is a low level programming language, why does it care about async?

Zig describes itself as ageneral purposelanguage for maintainingrobust,optimalandreusablesoftware. Making sure that you can exploit non-blocking syscalls in order to maximize CPU usage is part of the main goals of the language. As an individual user you don’t need special support in the language to be able to use APIs like io_uring or kqueue, but having a standardized way of doing so ensures that any third party code you use will also play nice with your I/O strategy, thus achieving better code reusability.

### Are Zig package authors now forced to use async everywhere in their code to be good citizens of the ecosystem?

No, if you write normal sequential code, it will still be able to play nice with the overall I/O strategy chosen by your users. Additionally, many I/O libraries don’t have the necessity to express any concurrency across their own operations because most of the time those still need to be scheduled sequentially (e.g. database clients).

That said there are other aspects of the new I/O system that might be worth making sure to integrate in your code, like support forWriter.sendFile, for example.

### So I can plug in any execution model and everything will work correctly every single time?

Yes, unless the code contains a programming error.

Imagine that you made a program that spins up a listening socket (the server component), and then at the same time it also wants to open a connection to it (the client component):

var

server

=

io
.
async
(
startServer
,

.
{
io
}
)
;

var

client

=

io
.
async
(
startClient
,

.
{
io
}
)
;


In a blocking I/O execution context the program will block onsocket.accept()inside ofstartServerand will never get to start executingstartClient.

That saidit should be noted that this is a programming error.io.asyncexpressesasynchronicity(the possibility for operations to happen out of order and still be correct) and it does not requestconcurrency, which in this case is necessary for the code to work correctly.

Astute readers might have noticed that the code snippet above hides another bug: the server and the client in reality cannot be started concurrently! The client connection can only be opened successfully if the server has already started listening, which is not guaranteed by the code above.

A correct implementation needs to correctly distinguish between what needs to happen sequentially, what can be executed out of order, and what needs to execute concurrently:

const

server_socket

=

try

openServerSocket
(
io
)
;

var

server

=

try

io
.
asyncConcurrent
(
startAccepting
,

.
{


io
,

server_socket
,

}
)
;

defer
 server
.
cancel
(
io
)

catch

{
}
;

var

client

=

io
.
async
(
startClient
,

.
{
io
}
)
;

defer
 client
.
cancel
(
io
)

catch

{
}
;

Lastly,io.asyncConcurrentcannot be implemented with single-threaded blocking I/O, therefore calling this function when using such implementation would panic due to a programming error.
