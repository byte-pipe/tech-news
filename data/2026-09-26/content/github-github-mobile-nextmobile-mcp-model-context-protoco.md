# Mobile Next - MCP server for Mobile Development and Automation | iOS, Android, Simulator, Emulator, and Real Devices

English|日本語|简体中文

This is an MCP Server that enables scalable mobile automation, development through a platform-agnostic interface, eliminating the need for distinct iOS or Android knowledge. You can run it on emulators, simulators, and real devices (iOS and Android).

This server allows Agents and LLMs to interact with native iOS/Android applications and devices through structured accessibility snapshots or coordinate-based taps based on screenshots.

Works with Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, GitHub Copilot, Antigravity— or any MCP-compatible client.

Run it against devices on your own machine, or against real iOS and Android devices in the cloud withMobile Next Cloud— same tools, no local setup.

mobile-next-mcp-video.mp4

### Main use cases

How we help to scale mobile automation:

* 📲 Native app automation (iOS and Android) for testing or data-entry scenarios.
* 📝 Scripted flows and form interactions without manually controlling simulators/emulators or real devices (iPhone, Samsung, Google Pixel etc)
* 🧭 Automating multi-step user journeys driven by an LLM
* 👆 General-purpose mobile application interaction for agent-based frameworks
* 🤖 Enables agent-to-agent communication for mobile automation usecases, data extraction

## Main Features

* 🚀Accessibility-first — fast and cheap: drives apps from the native accessibility tree (no vision model, no image tokens), falling back to screenshots + coordinates only when needed.
* 📱One API, every target: the same tools work across iOS and Android — simulators, emulators, and real devices.
* 🧠No platform expertise required: no XCUITest, no Espresso, no per-platform glue — describe the goal and the agent does it.
* 🧰Full device control: taps, swipes, and gestures; app install/launch/terminate; screen recording; hardware buttons; deep links; orientation.
* 📊Structured, deterministic output: reads real UI elements and extracts structured data, cutting the ambiguity of screenshot-only approaches.

Or add the standard config undermcpServersin your settings as shown above.

Read more in our wiki! 🚀

### ✅ Verify it works

Once the server is configured, ask your agent to list devices:

list available devices

You should get back your running simulators, emulators, and connected devices. If you do, Mobile MCP is wired up correctly. If the list is empty, make sure a simulator or emulator is running (seePrerequisites) — for more help, check thewiki.

### ☁️ Scale up, use a cloud device

Want to scale to hundreds of devices? Use Mobile MCP in your CI/CD pipeline?

In your Agent, prompt:

log in to mobile next cloud and then show me which remote devices are available to me

### Streamable HTTP Server Mode

By default, Mobile MCP runs over stdio. To start aStreamable HTTPserver instead, use the--listenflag:

npx @mobilenext/mobile-mcp@latest --listen 3000

This binds tolocalhost:3000. To bind to a specific interface:

npx @mobilenext/mobile-mcp@latest --listen 0.0.0.0:3000

Then configure your MCP client to connect tohttp://<host>:3000/mcp(orhttps://…/mcpbehind TLS). The endpoint accepts Streamable HTTP (POSTon/mcp); remote mode isstateless(no session affinity required), which works well with Smithery and other horizontal hosts.

Migration note:--listenpreviously served the deprecated HTTP+SSE transport on/mcp. Clients must use Streamable HTTP againsthttp(s)://host:port/mcp. The old pure-SSE flow on/mcpis no longer available.

When binding to localhost, Host-header DNS rebinding protection is enabled automatically.

#### Authorization

To require Bearer token authorization on the HTTP server, set theMOBILEMCP_AUTHenvironment variable:

MOBILEMCP_AUTH=my-secret-token npx @mobilenext/mobile-mcp@latest --listen 3000

When set, all requests must include the headerAuthorization: Bearer my-secret-token. When unset, the server accepts unauthenticated connections and logs a warning.

### 🛠️ How to Use

After adding the MCP server to your IDE/Client, you can instruct your AI assistant to use the available tools.
For example, in Cursor's agent mode, you could use the prompts below to quickly validate, test and iterate on UI interactions, read information from screen, go through complex workflows.
Be descriptive, straight to the point.

### ✨ Example Prompts

#### Workflows

You can specify detailed workflows in a single prompt, verify business logic, setup automations. You can go crazy:

Search for a video, comment, like and share it.

Find the video called " Beginner Recipe for Tonkotsu Ramen" by Way of
Ramen, click on like video, after liking write a comment " this was
delicious, will make it next Friday", share the video with the first
contact in your whatsapp list.

Download a successful step counter app, register, setup workout and 5-star the app

Find and Download a free "Pomodoro" app that has more than 1k stars.
Launch the app, register with my email, after registration find how to
start a pomodoro timer. When the pomodoro timer started, go back to the
app store and rate the app 5 stars, and leave a comment how useful the
app is.

Search in Substack, read, highlight, comment and save an article

Open Substack website, search for "Latest trends in AI automation 2025",
open the first article, highlight the section titled "Emerging AI trends",
and save article to reading list for later review, comment a random
paragraph summary.

Reserve a workout class, set timer

Open ClassPass, search for yoga classes tomorrow morning within 2 miles,
book the highest-rated class at 7 AM, confirm reservation,
setup a timer for the booked slot in the phone

Find a local event, setup calendar event

Open Eventbrite, search for AI startup meetup events happening this
weekend in "Austin, TX", select the most popular one, register and RSVP
yes to the event, setup a calendar event as a reminder.

Check weather forecast and send a Whatsapp/Telegram/Slack message

Open Weather app, check tomorrow's weather forecast for "Berlin", and
send the summary via Whatsapp/Telegram/Slack to contact "Lauren Trown",
thumbs up their response.

* Schedule a meeting in Zoom and share invite via email

Open Zoom app, schedule a meeting titled "AI Hackathon" for tomorrow at
10AM with a duration of 1 hour, copy the invitation link, and send it via
Gmail to contacts "team@example.com".

## Running & configuration

### Environment variables

Variable

Description

Example

MOBILEMCP_AUTH

Require a Bearer token on the Streamable HTTP server (
--listen
) — every request must then send 
Authorization: Bearer <token>
.

MOBILEMCP_AUTH=my-secret-token

MOBILEMCP_DISABLE_TELEMETRY

Disable anonymous usage telemetry.

MOBILEMCP_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1

MOBILEMCP_ALLOW_UNSAFE_URLS

Allow 
mobile_open_url
 to open non-standard URL schemes (blocked by default).

MOBILEMCP_ALLOW_UNSAFE_URLS=1

MOBILEMCP_LEGACY_ROBOT

Use the legacy platform-specific robots for Android devices and physical iOS devices. iOS simulators continue to use 
mobilecli
.

MOBILEMCP_LEGACY_ROBOT=1

### Simulators, Emulators, and Real Devices

When launched, Mobile MCP can connect to:

* iOS Simulators on macOS/Linux
* Android Emulators on Linux/Windows/macOS
* iOS or Android real devices (requires proper platform tools and drivers)

Make sure you have your mobile platform SDKs (Xcode, Android SDK) installed and configured properly before running Mobile Next Mobile MCP.

### Telemetry

Mobile MCP collects anonymous usage telemetry via PostHog and Scarf. To disable it, set theMOBILEMCP_DISABLE_TELEMETRYenvironment variable:

MOBILEMCP_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1 npx @mobilenext/mobile-mcp@latest

For json configurations:

{
 
"mcpServers"
: {
 
"mobile-mcp"
: {
 
"command"
: 
"
npx
"
,
 
"args"
: [
"
-y
"
, 
"
@mobilenext/mobile-mcp@latest
"
],
 
"env"
: {
 
"MOBILEMCP_DISABLE_TELEMETRY"
: 
"
1
"

 }
 }
 }
}

### Running in "headless" mode on Simulators/Emulators

When you do not have a real device connected to your machine, you can run Mobile MCP with an emulator or simulator in the background.

For example, on Android:

1. Start an emulator (avdmanager / emulator command).
2. Run Mobile MCP with the desired flags

On iOS, you'll need Xcode and to run the Simulator before using Mobile MCP with that simulator instance.

* xcrun simctl list
* xcrun simctl boot "iPhone 16"

## 🧩 Part of Mobile Next

Mobile MCP is one piece of a toolkit for driving real mobile devices:

* mobilewright— "Playwright for mobile." When you're ready to turn agent-driven exploration intorepeatable, deterministic testsfor iOS and Android, graduate to mobilewright.
* mobilecli— the universal device CLI that Mobile MCP is built on: control devices, simulators, and emulators from the command line or a JSON-RPC API.
* Mobile Next Cloud— the same stack, rented: real iOS and Android devices on demand. Just prompt your agent:log in to mobile next cloud and then show me which remote devices are available to meto get started.

## 🚀 Roadmap

We're continuously improving Mobile MCP. See what we're building next inROADMAP.md— priorities are shaped heavily by community feedback, so tell us what you'd like to see.
