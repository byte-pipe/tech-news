## 1. Abstract

Android’s Always-on VPN and “Block connections without VPN” settings create a
user-visible expectation that traffic attributable to covered applications will
not leave through a non-VPN path. A normal application can violate that boundary
through Android’s public NAT-T socket-keepalive API, causing clear, fixed-format
UDP/4500 packets to reach the physical router outside the VPN path. The runtime
evidence has three levels. A controlled access-point capture on a Pixel 8 Pro
running Android 16 buildCP1A.260505.005recorded the packets at the public
minimum 10-second interval while Always-on VPN and lockdown were enabled. A
Samsung SM-F966B running Android 16 exposed one active Wi-Fi slot through the
same public path; VPN Leak Guard selected the physical IPv4 default gateway,
observed the active callback, and recorded a continuous router-directed
active-slot lease for 24 h 32 min. On a Nothing A059 (Asteroids) running
Android 16, the same implementation selected the physical gateway and recorded
one active Wi-Fi slot. The Nothing result confirms public-path admission and the
active callback on a third OEM. No independent packet capture or duration
measurement was collected for that device. The Pixel lifecycle matrix covered
backgrounding, lock, Doze, battery saver, restricted standby bucket, Binder
freezer, and the observed force-stop, uninstall, network-loss, and reboot
boundaries.

Source history traces the failure to a collapsed trust model instartNattKeepaliveWithFd(...): a privileged raw-fd API evolved into a publicUdpEncapsulationSocketpath, resource validation was added and reverted, and
admission no longer authenticates the fd/resource pair or enforces the original
caller UID’s current VPN policy before offload. In an F-Droid/IzzyOnDroid study
of 4,679 distinct stored Git origins, the scanner detected no Android framework
IPsec, IKE, or NAT-T API use; manual audit found 73 AndroidVpnServiceapps.
Runtime confirmation across three OEMs and two confirmed WLAN families, the
shared Android 12+ framework path, and firmware coverage across seven WLAN
families representing 91.24% of estimated Android-derived shipments establish
device-class exposure affecting most Android 12+ devices. The remaining 8.76%
is unresolved.

## 2. Introduction

VPN lockdown governs routing and confinement in addition to encryption. Users
and administrators expect covered applications to fail closed when the VPN is
unavailable and to withhold their real network identity from destinations
outside the tunnel. Prior VPN-leak research has studied routing exceptions,
IPv6 and DNS leaks, WebRTC address exposure, VPN client ecosystems, and shared
VPN infrastructure failures [1;2;3;4;5;6;7]. Android also delegates some
application-triggered packet emission tosystem_server, a NetworkAgent, a
hardware abstraction layer, or firmware, beyond the application’s ordinary
socket send path.

A normal application can cross that boundary through the public Android-managedIpSecManager.UdpEncapsulationSocketand askConnectivityManager.createSocketKeepalive(...)to maintain a NAT-T mapping.
The framework routes the request throughstartNattKeepaliveWithFd(...),
accepts the duplicated fd and resource ID without proving current caller-owned
IpSec resource identity, and hands a completed NAT-T keepalive packet to the
Wi-Fi keepalive offload path without first enforcing the caller UID’s effective
VPN-lockdown policy. A controlled Pixel 8 Pro capture recorded the resulting
UDP/4500 packet on the physical access-point interface. Active-slot
observations on two additional OEMs exercised the same public
physical-gateway path on Qualcomm hardware
[8;9;10;11;12;13;14;15;16;17].

Recent Android Automotive access-control work identifiedConnectivityService.startNattKeepaliveWithFdin a broad sweep of framework
permission anomalies because a related keepalive API enforcedPACKET_KEEPALIVE_OFFLOADand the fd-based path did not [18;19;20]. That work reported the permission
inconsistency. It did not trace the publicUdpEncapsulationSockettrust split,
the reverted IpSec resource validation, or physical Wi-Fi emission under VPN
lockdown.

The platform fixes the packet shape, but the caller chooses the destination
within the API and routing constraints. Repeated packets disclose the physical
network’s source address and timing to that destination after the user has
enabled blocking without the VPN. This violates lockdown’s identity-confinement
property without requiring arbitrary payload control.

## 3. Background: Android VPN Lockdown and NAT-T Keepalive Offload

### 3.1 Android VPN Lockdown

Android’s VPN model can route covered application traffic into a VPN app’s TUN
interface. Always-on VPN keeps the selected VPN active, and the user-facing
“Block connections without VPN” setting is intended to prevent covered traffic
from using non-secure networks outside that VPN path
[21;22]. In the normal case,
an application write traverses the socket layer, per-UID network policy, fwmark
and netd routing state, VPN UID-range routing, firewall/prohibit rules, and
eventually the VPN TUN interface when the UID is covered by the VPN.

The normal VPN-protected path is:

covered app UID

 -> socket connect/write

 -> fwmark/netd policy and VPN UID range checks

 -> lockdown prohibit/fail-closed decision when needed

 -> VPN app TUN interface

 -> encrypted VPN tunnel over an allowed underlay

The relevant security property covers traffic and delegated packet emission
attributable to a covered non-owner application. Such emission must stay off
non-VPN interfaces unless the platform defines an explicit exemption. VPN-owner
underlay traffic, configured split tunnels, documented platform probes, and
privileged system functions may follow separate policy.

Android separately records which package ispreparedto act as the VPN for
each user.VpnService.prepare()may require user consent; the service itself
must be declared withBIND_VPN_SERVICE. InVpn, the prepared package is
paired with its installed owner UID so uninstall/reinstall and package-only
comparisons do not preserve authority. An APK that merely declares a VPN
service is not the prepared VPN, and prior consent that has been revoked is not
current approval [23;24]. The installed owner
UID and current prepared package provide the authority needed for keepalive
admission.

### 3.2 NAT-T Socket Keepalive Offload

NAT traversal for IPsec commonly uses UDP port 4500. Android exposes a public
API path in which an application creates anIpSecManager.UdpEncapsulationSocketand asksConnectivityManager.createSocketKeepalive(...)to maintain the NAT
mapping [8;9]. Internally,
this path passes a duplicated file descriptor and an
IpSec resource ID toIConnectivityManager.startNattKeepaliveWithFd(...), which
then reachesConnectivityService,KeepaliveTracker, a NetworkAgent, and
transport-specific Wi-Fi or cellular keepalive machinery
[10;11;12].

The NAT-T keepalive offload path is:

app UID

 -> IpSecManager.openUdpEncapsulationSocket()

 -> ConnectivityManager.createSocketKeepalive(...)

 -> NattSocketKeepalive.startImpl()

 -> IConnectivityManager.startNattKeepaliveWithFd(...)

 -> ConnectivityService / KeepaliveTracker

 -> NetworkAgent

 -> Wi-Fi HAL / chipset firmware

 -> UDP/4500 keepalive on physical Wi-Fi

The Wi-Fi offload path can emit keepalive frames without waking the application
or performing a new socket write for each packet. After framework admission,
the final emitter sits below the ordinary app socket path that VPN lockdown
normally controls.

The public keepalive path, Wi-Fi HAL offload methods, and compatibility slot
requirements are shared platform interfaces below the ordinary app socket path
[25;8;26].

## 4. Threat Model and Expected Lockdown Behavior

### 4.1 Expected Lockdown Behavior

Under Always-on VPN and “Block connections without VPN,” a covered normal
application must not cause Android-managed NAT-T keepalive packets to leave over
the physical network outside the VPN tunnel. If the caller’s full Android UID
is covered by a non-bypassable or lockdown VPN, the publicUdpEncapsulationSocketkeepalive request should fail, remain unsupported, or
be stopped before Wi-Fi or cellular offload emits UDP/4500 traffic on the
physical underlay.

The security goal applies to NAT-T emission attributable to a covered normal
app. Android’s documented policies for VPN-owner underlay traffic, configured
split tunnels, and privileged platform functions remain separate. Acceptance of
an unauthenticated public fd/resource pair cannot confer physical-underlay
offload authority.

### 4.2 Attacker

The attacker controls a normal Android application installed on the victim
device and controls or observes a UDP/4500 endpoint on the Internet. The
validated public-API path does not require root, ADB, hidden API access, JNI,
raw Binder construction, a dangerous runtime permission prompt, or the
privilegedPACKET_KEEPALIVE_OFFLOADpermission. The local PoC variants
declared ordinary networking capabilities such asINTERNETandACCESS_NETWORK_STATE.

### 4.3 Victim Configuration

The victim device has Always-on VPN enabled and “Block connections without VPN”
enabled for the attacker’s UID. Runtime confirmation used Android 16
configurations across multiple OEMs. The Pixel 8 Pro run used a
researcher-controlled Wi-Fi network and an external physical-interface capture;
the Qualcomm-based devices supplied active physical-gateway slot observations
[21;22;27;15;16;17].

ADB and root were used for research instrumentation and packet collection.
Neither is an exploitation precondition for the public API path.

## 5. Vulnerability: NAT-T Keepalive Lockdown Bypass

### 5.1 Public API Sequence

The practical attack uses the documented public path:

IpSecManager
.
UdpEncapsulationSocket
 
socket
 
=

 
ipSecManager
.
openUdpEncapsulationSocket
();

SocketKeepalive
 
keepalive
 
=
 
connectivityManager
.
createSocketKeepalive
(

 
network
,

 
socket
,

 
sourceAddress
,

 
destinationAddress
,

 
executor
,

 
callback
);

keepalive
.
start
(
10
);

The public API converges on the fd-based Binder method also used by hidden
raw-fd paths. The controlled on-wire Wi-Fi result used this documented sequence;
raw Binder was unnecessary
[8;9;10].

### 5.2 Packet Path and Missing Decision

NattSocketKeepalive.startImpl()callsIConnectivityManager.startNattKeepaliveWithFd(...);ConnectivityServiceforwards the request throughKeepaliveTrackerto the
NetworkAgent and Wi-Fi backend. No admission decision checks the original
caller’s effective VPN policy before hardware offload. Once handed to the Wi-Fi
backend, repeated emission is outside the normal app socket writes intercepted
by per-UID VPN routing and lockdown firewall rules
[11;12;26].

### 5.3 Scope of Packet Control

The attacker controls the destination address within the API and routing
constraints and observes the real source address exposed by the physical
network. The platform fixes the NAT-T payload. The primitive leaks the real IP
address and timing/cadence; it does not carry arbitrary application content.

### 5.4 Raw Binder as Supporting Evidence

Raw Binder diagnostics show that the server does not authenticate the supplied
file descriptor or claimed IpSec resource. The reviewed validation path reports
thatisNattKeepaliveSocketValid(fd, resourceId)accepts every non-null fd and does
not meaningfully consultresourceId; bogus values such as0,-2,Integer.MAX_VALUE, andInteger.MIN_VALUEare not ownership checks. These
diagnostics support the resource-authenticity finding. The VPN-lockdown result
uses the documented public API and is independent of a stable Binder
transaction number or hidden API construction. The source-line anchors areKeepaliveTracker.makeNattKeepaliveInfo(... resourceId ...)andisNattKeepaliveSocketValid(...)on the reviewed AOSP Connectivity branch
[12].

Supplemental fuzzing found broad IPv4 destination acceptance after admission
and route-driven IPv6 behavior. Neither result is a prerequisite for the
VPN-lockdown bypass.

## 6. Root Cause: Collapsed Trust Model and Abandoned Resource Validation

The fd-based Binder method combines two trust models. The original raw-fd NAT-T
keepalive API was privileged. During API review, publicUdpEncapsulationSocketkeepalives were routed through the same method, and the
unconditional permission check was removed to support public IpSec/IKE
applications. Secure admission then required public callers to prove ownership
of a liveIpSecServiceencap-socket resource while raw-fd callers without such
a resource remained privileged.

Two checks are absent. The server accepts a public NAT-T keepalive request
without proving that the duplicated fd corresponds to a live caller-owned IpSec
encap-socket resource. It also starts the offload path without checking whether
VPN/lockdown policy for the caller UID blocks physical-underlay emission. Once
admitted, the Wi-Fi offload path emits below the ordinary app socket path where
lockdown would normally constrain the caller.

Source history shows that resource validation and lifetime locking were briefly
added. The implementation validated caller UID ownership, pinned the encap
socket for the keepalive lifetime, rejected duplicate active use, and released
the resource on final stop. It was reverted because of service dependency and
deadlock concerns. Per-UID/per-network quotas replaced it. Quotas limit resource
exhaustion; they do not authenticate the fd/resource pair, preserve an IpSec
lifetime lease, or enforce VPN policy.

The commit IDs were rechecked against the AOSPpackages/modules/ConnectivityGitiles repository on 2026-05-30
[28].

One encap resource cannot back two active NAT-T keepalives.

The public API duplicates aUdpEncapsulationSocketfd, passessocket.getResourceId()throughNattSocketKeepalive, and callsIConnectivityManager.startNattKeepaliveWithFd(...)with the fd, resource ID,
automatic-on/off state, andunderpinnedNetwork.ConnectivityServiceforwards
those fields toKeepaliveTracker; the existing socket validation accepts
non-null fd state without proving that the fd matches a live caller-owned IpSec
resource and without enforcing effective VPN policy before the NetworkAgent or
transport backend starts hardware offload [9;10;11;12].

## 7. Evaluation

The runtime evidence has three distinct levels. On the Pixel 8 Pro Wi-Fi
configuration, Android accepted a public NAT-T keepalive request from a normal
application and emitted repeated UDP/4500 packets on the physical Wi-Fi
interface while VPN lockdown remained enabled. The authoritative observation
point for that controlled matrix is an OpenWrt AP/router tcpdump on a separate
device, because packets observed there have already crossed Android’s VPN
policy boundary. A Samsung SM-F966B independently confirmed the same public
path on Qualcomm WLAN hardware by maintaining one active, router-directed
physical Wi-Fi slot through a lease exceeding one day. A Nothing A059 on
Qualcomm hardware provided third-OEM public-path admission and active-callback
confirmation through one physical-gateway Wi-Fi slot, without an external packet
capture or duration measurement.

### 7.1 Controlled Pixel Packet Capture

The public NAT-T keepalive path produced on-wire UDP/4500 traffic on physical
Wi-Fi while lockdown was enabled. The separate OpenWrt AP/router recorded a
one-byte UDP payload every 10 seconds:

2026-05-28 18:36:31.709917 phy1-ap0 P IP 192.168.1.182.38904 > 1.2.3.4.4500: UDP, length 1

2026-05-28 18:36:41.710042 phy1-ap0 P IP 192.168.1.182.38904 > 1.2.3.4.4500: UDP, length 1

The public path usedIpSecManager.openUdpEncapsulationSocket()andConnectivityManager.createSocketKeepalive(...); no root, ADB, hidden API,
raw Binder construction, JNI, dangerous runtime permission, orPACKET_KEEPALIVE_OFFLOADpermission was required for the app-side primitive.

The caller chooses the destination within API and routing constraints. The
receiver observes the device’s real non-VPN source address and cadence; the
payload remains the platform’s fixed NAT-T keepalive format.

### 7.2 Independent Samsung Runtime Confirmation

VPN Leak Guard produced an independent cross-OEM runtime result on a Samsung
SM-F966B running Android 16 buildBP4A.251205.006.F966BXXUABZF1on Qualcomm
hardware. Its keepalive implementation excludes VPN logical networks, selects
the physical network’s validated IPv4 default gateway, opensIpSecManager.UdpEncapsulationSocket, and callsConnectivityManager.createSocketKeepalive(...)with that physical network
and gateway as the UDP/4500 destination. The Samsung run received the active
callback and exposed one active physical-gateway Wi-Fi slot
[13;15].

The observation snapshot records both the highest and latest Wi-Fi slot counts as
one. A sanitized screenshot records the same slot still active at a lease
uptime of 24 h 32 min
[17]. This is independent runtime confirmation
of the vulnerable public path and physical-gateway destination on a
Samsung/Qualcomm stack. The Pixel matrix remains the only controlled external
packet capture; Samsung supplies the active-slot and lease measurements.

### 7.3 Nothing Active-Slot Confirmation

VPN Leak Guard also recorded a Nothing A059, device and productAsteroids,
boardvolcano, on Qualcomm (qcom) hardware. It ran Android 16, SDK 36,
security patch2026-06-01, build IDBQ2A.250721.001-BP2A.250605.031.A3. The protector excludes VPN logical
networks, selects the validated physical IPv4 default gateway, and marks a slot
active only whenSocketKeepalive.Callback.onStarted()runs. The observation
report factory omits zero-slot maxima. The read-only snapshot records both the
highest and latest active Wi-Fi slot counts as one
[13;14;16].

The row confirms public physical-gateway admission and the active callback on a
third OEM. Its evidence is limited to the active-slot result; no router capture,
packet cadence, lease duration, lifecycle, persistence, or reboot result was
collected.

### 7.4 Controls and Baselines

The ordinary UDP lockdown control recorded app-side UDP sends while the router
capture recorded no matching UDP/4500 or UDP/12345 packets. Ordinary
lockdown-covered UDP was therefore confined or absent from the physical capture
while the NAT-T keepalive offload appeared at the AP boundary.

Three policy baselines bound the interpretation. With VPN and lockdown disabled,
ordinary UDP and keepalive traffic were visible on the router. With VPN enabled
and lockdown disabled, keepalive traffic was visible on the router while
ordinary UDP was observed through the VPN interface. With both VPN and lockdown
enabled, keepalive traffic was still visible on the router while the ordinary UDP
lockdown control remained absent from the physical capture.

### 7.5 Lifecycle Behavior

Once armed on the Pixel, the keepalive remained active through backgrounding,
screen lock, forced idle, battery saver, restricted standby bucket, Binder
freezer/process observation, and GrapheneOS
relock/back-to-BFU-without-reboot while the device stayed powered. On the
Samsung, the single active Wi-Fi slot remained continuously leased for a
measured period exceeding one day and was still active when the sanitized
evidence screenshot was taken.

The observed stop boundaries were manual force stop, uninstall, network loss,
and reboot. Packets were present before the force-stop, uninstall, and reboot
actions; Wi-Fi loss stopped the active keepalive with a network-loss error, and a
manual re-arm restored it after Wi-Fi returned.

### 7.6 Slot Counts and Lease

The tested Pixel 8 Pro Wi-Fi configuration exposed one unprivileged keepalive
slot to the app UID after privileged reservations. One slot was accepted, later
slot attempts failed withERROR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES (-32). The Samsung
SM-F966B independently exposed one active Wi-Fi slot and held it through the
measured lease. The Nothing A059 exposed one active Wi-Fi slot; no duration was
measured for that row
[16].

## 8. Impact

The direct attacker value is repeated real-network identity disclosure. A
destination controlled by the attacker can learn the source IP address as seen
from the physical Wi-Fi network, the fact that the device remains online, and
packet timing while the keepalive remains armed. Depending on the network, the
source IP can imply ISP, organization, travel state, or correlation between a
device expected to be behind a VPN and a non-VPN access network.

The value of the leak comes from the user-visible lockdown promise: covered
applications are expected to fail closed rather than reveal non-VPN network
identity to attacker-chosen destinations. Even without payload exfiltration, a
periodic signal can support presence checks, IP correlation, and timing
correlation against other observations. The measured Samsung lease exceeded one
day.

### 8.1 Device-Class Exposure

The reviewed IEEE and Wi-Fi Alliance material contains no generic WLAN
keepalive-offload mandate. Public implementation history instead points to
low-power NIC/driver contracts and vendor FullMAC firmware interfaces. By 2009,
Windows 7’s NDIS 6.20 model supported
low-power ARP, IPv6 Neighbor Solicitation, and 802.11 RSN/GTK offloads; in 2011,
IEEE 802.11v standardized adjacent Wireless Network Management keep-alive and
proxy mechanisms; by 2014, public Android WLAN source evidence shows Qualcomm
firmware command surfaces for STA keepalive and IPsec NAT keepalive; and by
Android 6 / Marshmallow in 2015, AOSP included hidden NAT-T keepalive framework
support. Android compatibility requirements for app-visible Wi-Fi keepalive
offload appeared later, in the Android 10 CDD in 2019
[29;30;31;32;33].

App-visible slots are part of the Android compatibility model. Android 10’s 2019
CDD requires devices that expose Wi-Fi keepalive offload to support theSocketKeepaliveAPI and at least three concurrent Wi-Fi keepalive slots.
Slot/resource checks found no manufacturer overlay that deliberately zeroed the
relevant defaults.

Runtime results cross OEM boundaries within the two confirmed WLAN families.
The Pixel 8 Pro/Broadcom configuration emitted packets in the controlled AP
capture. The Samsung SM-F966B/Qualcomm configuration maintained an active
router-directed Wi-Fi slot through the measured lease. Another Qualcomm-based
OEM admitted the public physical-gateway path and reached the active callback
for one Wi-Fi slot
[27;34;35;13;14;15;16;17].

The vulnerable admission path is shared Android 12+ framework behavior, making
the relevant platform window start with Android 12’s 2021 release. The
firmware/source census finds
keepalive or offloaded-packet support surfaces across all seven tracked Android
WLAN stack families: Qualcomm QCA/CLD3/FastConnect, Qualcomm WLAN/QDSP6 WCNSS,
Broadcom/Cypress bcmdhd/DHD, MediaTek CONSYS/Connac, Unisoc/Spreadtrum SPRDWL,
Samsung S.LSI/Exynos Wi-Fi, and Huawei/HiSilicon Hi11xx. The first-observed
public support evidence across those families spans 2014 through 2020
[33;36;37;38].

Runtime confirmation across three OEMs and two confirmed WLAN families, the
shared Android 12+ implementation, slot defaults, and the seven-family firmware
census establish device-class exposure affecting most Android 12+ devices. The
mapped WLAN families represent 91.24% of estimated Android/AOSP-derived
shipments from 2021Q4 through 2026Q1. The remaining 8.76% is unresolved
mixed/long-tail SKU coverage
[39;36].

## 9. Application Ecosystem Study

Public API availability does not establish compatibility demand. A static
F-Droid/IzzyOnDroid study measured use of Android’s framework IPsec, IKE, and
NAT-T machinery. Across the scanned origins, the scanner found zero framework
API uses and zero method-specific raw Binder invocations of the corresponding
transactions
[40;41].

### 9.1 Corpus and Method

The collection run downloaded the signed F-Droid and IzzyOnDroid v1 indexes on
2026-07-05, extracted and normalized declared source URLs, and cloned available
repositories. This produced 4,888 package-keyed per-checkout reports. Those
reports contain 4,679 distinct storedgitOriginstrings; the table below
de-duplicates package-keyed observations by exact stored origin and does not
merge differently spelled URLs that might identify the same upstream project.

The analysis was static and lexical: it scanned source and manifest files for
framework API references, method-specific raw Binder transactions, and VPN
comparison candidates, while excluding generated build directories, dependency
caches, Git metadata, and files above the scanner’s size limit. The VPN
comparison candidates were then manually audited for intentional user-facing
AndroidVpnService/TUN-style behavior. Catalog entries, clone targets, or
source checkouts that were unavailable to the scanner remain outside the
distinct-origin denominator.

The scan result is:

Observed concept
Distinct origins
Share
Android framework IPsec, IKE, or NAT-T API use
0
0.00%
Method-specific raw Binder invocation of IPsec/IKE/NAT-T transactions
0
0.00%
Manually audited Android 
VpnService
 apps
73
1.56%

The manually auditedVpnServiceset confirms that the scanned corpus contains
ordinary Android VPN applications. Those apps use the standardVpnServicepath; none supplied a framework IPsec/IKE/NAT-T match.

### 9.2 Interpretation

Android exposes transform construction, SPI allocation, UDP encapsulation,
framework IKE negotiation, migration, state queries, and hardware NAT-T offload
to ordinary applications. The sample found no use of that framework machinery.
The proposed repair targets NAT-T keepalive admission around fd/resource
ownership and effective VPN-lockdown policy; ordinary Java/NDK networking and
theVpnServicepath remain outside its scope.

F-Droid and IzzyOnDroid exclude much proprietary enterprise VPN software, OEM
clients, carrier software, and sideloaded closed-source applications. The zero
therefore describes this open-source sample and cannot establish universal
absence.

### 9.3 Google Play Cross-Check

A Google Play and web census dated 2026-07-29 found 29 candidates: 26 were
currently listed and 3 had been removed. APKs were acquired for 9 of the 26
current listings; 17 remained listing-only. The acquired set comprised 8
proprietary APKs and 1 open-source APK. Two proprietary APKs contained all 47
verified platform-SDK call sites: 37 in FortiClient VPN and 10 in SmartVPN. The
other 7 acquired APKs contained none
[42].

FortiClient VPN had 3,995,326 cumulative Google Play installs and SmartVPN had
139,322, totaling 4,134,648. Google Play exposes these exact cumulative-install
fields behind rounded public download badges
[42].

“Stale” means still listed but not updated for more than three years on
2026-07-29. Six candidates were removed or stale
[42]:

The DEX verifier counts aninvoke-*instruction targeting a platform method,

reference.

## 10. Mitigation and Regression Tests

A repair for any retained normal-app path should preserve authorized NAT-T
keepalives while making physical-underlay offload fail closed for covered normal
apps. The fix point is admission tostartNattKeepaliveWithFd(...)and the
associated keepalive lifetime: the platform must authenticate the fd/resource
pair, decide whether the caller may emit on the selected physical network, and
stop the record if that authorization becomes stale.

### 10.1 NAT-T Repair Responsibilities

* Raw-fd callers without a valid public IpSec resource remain gated byPACKET_KEEPALIVE_OFFLOADand receive basic fd-shape validation.
* PublicUdpEncapsulationSocketcallers prove ownership of a liveIpSecServiceencap-socket resource, prove that the duplicated fd matches the
stored resource, and cannot reuse one resource for concurrent active NAT-T
records.
* ConnectivityServicecaptures the calling full UID before identity clearing,
checks the target network and anyunderpinnedNetworkrelationship, and
rejects physical-underlay offload when the effective VPN/lockdown policy for
that UID would block direct emission.
* KeepaliveTrackerand the transport backend start Wi-Fi or cellular offload
only after admission succeeds, and release the resource exactly once on
denial, construction failure, binder death, packet-replacement failure,
client stop, or final system stop.
* VPN, lockdown, owner, underlying-network, and selected-network changes revoke
or revalidate active and paused NAT-T records before they can resume emission.

### 10.2 Regression Tests

Regression tests for this bug should prove that unauthorized keepalives fail
before slot allocation, packet-filter installation, transport start, callback
success, or IpSec resource mutation. The minimum negative cases are:

* a covered normal app requests a public NAT-T keepalive while lockdown is
already enabled;
* a record admitted before lockdown is stopped when lockdown begins for the
caller’s UID range;
* running and paused records are stopped when the relevant VPN is removed,
replaced by a different owner, changes bypassability, or loses its underlying
network;
* stale, closed, mismatched, other-UID, and duplicate-active IpSec resources are
rejected before offload;
* raw-fd use with an invalid or absent resource ID requires the privileged
keepalive permission;
* denial and final-stop paths close incomingParcelFileDescriptors and release
any acquired IpSec lease exactly once.

Positive coverage should show that a legitimate caller with an owned live
encap-socket resource can still use NAT-T keepalive when its effective VPN
policy permits the selected physical emission
[11;12].

## 11. Disclosure, Ethics, and Artifacts

The finding was reported to the Android Vulnerability Reward Program on
2026-05-15. Google triaged the report the same day and requested coordinated
disclosure while Android Security assessed the issue. The reporter stated that
the finding had not been posted publicly or shared with third parties, submitted
additional validation material on 2026-05-17, and asked for disclosure guidance
after Google marked the report as a duplicate of canonical issue 386376240 on
2026-05-19.

The reporter notified Google of planned public disclosure through the VRP report
on 2026-06-12. The researcher-visible VRP API record then shows redacted Google
update markers from two accounts, dated 2026-06-12 and 2026-06-15; neither
exposes a comment body. The record contains no objection, delay request, CVE
assignment, fix-status update, severity decision, reward decision, or
publication clearance. Public disclosure began on 2026-07-29.

The experiments used researcher-controlled devices, VPN configurations, packet
captures, and endpoints. No third-party user traffic was collected. Released
artifacts are limited to sanitized evidence and reproduction material; private
VRP content, local identifiers, weaponized raw traces, and patch diffs are
excluded.

Competing interest: the author sells VPN Leak Guard, the commercial Android app
that produced the active-slot observations reported here.

## 12. Limitations

Runtime testing spans three device models and is not an exhaustive per-model
inventory. The Pixel 8 Pro/Broadcom result includes a controlled packet-capture
matrix. The Samsung SM-F966B/Qualcomm result includes an active
physical-gateway slot and measured lease. The Nothing A059/Qualcomm result
confirms public-path admission and the active callback; external packet capture
and duration remain unmeasured
[15;16].

Reboot persistence is not established. The Pixel keepalive stopped at the
observed reboot boundary, the Samsung lease was measured while the device
remained powered, and Nothing lifecycle and reboot behavior were not measured.

Cellular packet emission was not measured. The framework admission path is
transport-agnostic in source analysis, and Android 16 compatibility material
says cellular keepalive offload can be exposed to third-party apps with at least
one cellular slot. The tested Pixel default configuration returned insufficient
resources before a cellular modem path emitted traffic, and effective normal-app
execution depends on manufacturer slot overlays, hardware/HAL availability,
privileged slot reservations, per-UID unprivileged limits, and transport backend
behavior [25;8;43;12].

APKs were acquired for 9 of 26 current Google Play listings. Store counts are
cumulative across versions and VPN modes and do not identify active users or
platform-path use. DEX results apply to the acquired APK versions.

No patched Android build, patched-device packet capture, or complete
device-levelatestrun was performed. The repair remains source-level guidance
and requires implementation-level regression testing.

## 13. Related Work

VPN-leak comparisons depend on attacker position, trigger, endpoint control,
packet shape, cadence, enforcement layer, measured scope, and the user-visible
policy being bypassed. The NAT-T case uses a normal installed app to arm
repeated fixed UDP/4500 packets to an attacker-chosen Internet endpoint while
Android VPN lockdown is enabled.

TunnelCrack and TunnelVision-style work shows that routing exceptions and
hostile local-network conditions can defeat VPN expectations on affected
platforms [1;44;45;46]. Those attacks use a hostile local network; the NAT-T case
uses an installed app. Both test whether packets cross the expected VPN
boundary.

IPv6, DNS, WebRTC, and VPN ecosystem studies provide the broader privacy and
measurement context. Perta et al., Al-Fannah, Cho and Heidemann, Khan et al.,
VPNalyzer/VPNInspector, Wu et al., and Yang et al. show why source-IP exposure,
resolver behavior, shared VPN state, and careful measurement boundaries matter
[2;3;6;4;5;47;48;7].

These studies measure VPN behavior, infrastructure, privacy, or client
properties. The ecosystem study measures compatibility demand for
Android’s framework IPsec/IKE/NAT-T machinery. F-Droid and IzzyOnDroid make
source-level inspection possible
[40;41], but exclude much proprietary enterprise and
business VPN software. The resulting zero is therefore evidence for a
compatibility context around NAT-T keepalive admission and cannot estimate
universal Android-market prevalence.

AutoAcRaptor is the closest prior signal on the same Android framework entry
point. It was a broad AAOS access-control study that flaggedConnectivityService.startNattKeepaliveWithFdas a verified missing-permission
anomaly because a related keepalive API required the signature-levelPACKET_KEEPALIVE_OFFLOADpermission while the fd-based path did not
[18;19;20]. That work identified the
suspicious entry point but did not validate the Android phone VPN-lockdown
bypass. The NAT-T analysis connects the entry point to publicUdpEncapsulationSocketkeepalives, Wi-Fi offload, and on-wire packet emission
outside phone VPN lockdown.

Android QUIC close-payload delegated UDP send is the closest Android
delegated-send peer. It shows application-triggered UDP emission outside the
ordinary app VPN send path [49;50;51]. QUIC close-payload is a one-shot or event-driven
software send; NAT-T keepalive is repeated, fixed-format UDP/4500 Wi-Fi offload
traffic.

Mullvad’s Android connectivity-check and DNS-leak reports, GrapheneOS VPN
leak-blocking work, and local-link/multicast discussions show that Android VPN
enforcement has long depended on platform exceptions as well as VPN-app
behavior [52;53;54;55]. They differ
from the NAT-T case in endpoint control, trigger, cadence, and packet shape.
They also show that delegated or exempt traffic must be checked against the
user’s lockdown expectation.

## 14. Discussion

### 14.1 Review Failure and Fail-Closed Release Discipline

The public and privileged NAT-T paths reached the same Binder method with
different trust requirements and no complete admission boundary. Stronger
ownership, fd-identity, lifetime, duplicate-use, and invalid-resource checks
were added in 2019, then reverted for technically legitimate service-dependency
and deadlock concerns. Per-UID and per-network quotas replaced them, but quotas
limit resource consumption; they do not provide equivalent fd/resource
authenticity, lifetime, or VPN-policy gates
[28;12].

The remaining validation TODOs cover invalid, closed, stale, mismatched,
other-UID, and duplicate resources; raw-fd privilege; lease cleanup; and
authorization changes while a keepalive is active or paused. A technically
motivated reversion does not itself constitute the failure. Releasing the
normal-app path without equivalent controls, while those validation obligations
remained open, is a review and release-governance failure. That characterization
concerns the process and resulting control gap, not any individual contributor.

Unprivileged availability should have remained at zero slots until an acceptable
public/private API split and the complete security checks were ready. Resource
quotas cannot serve as release authorization for a physical-underlay emission
primitive.

### 14.2 Deprecate Normal-App IPsec Access

Android should deprecate the public app-facing IPsec, IKE, and NAT-T surface and
make the framework functionality system-privileged. Authenticated carrier,
IWLAN, VCN, platform VPN, and other platform-internal consumers should remain;
their current roles are not replaced merely by removing normal-app access
[56;57;58].

Normal apps should receive zero exposed slots by default. If legacy access must
remain, it should sit behind a default-off, reboot-required compatibility switch
with a release posture analogous to radio-generation controls. Ordinary VPN
apps can continue to run their own userspace protocol implementations throughVpnService[23].

The open-source scan found 0 platform consumers across 4,679 origins; the Play
study found 2 among 9 acquired APKs. FortiClient VPN and SmartVPN have 4,134,648
cumulative Google Play installs between them, while Google reports more than 3
billion active Android devices. Both apps also support VPN modes that do not use
the platform path. I estimate that at most 0.01% of Android users—about one in
10,000—depend on these platform APIs. That constituency is too small to justify
leaving normal-app access enabled by default.
[40;41;42;59]

### 14.3 Router-Terminated VPN Guidance

For threat models that cannot tolerate a phone-side VPN escape, a
VPN-enforcing external router is the conservative community consensus among
identifiable privacy and security practitioners. Mullvad reported recurring
Android bypass classes in 2022 for connectivity checks, in 2024 for DNS, and
in 2026 for application-triggered QUIC traffic. IVPN independently reproduced
the 2026 QUIC path, and GrapheneOS community guidance recommends an external
router that tunnels the phone’s upstream traffic
[52;53;60;61;62].

These reports cover different mechanisms and do not imply that all Android
traffic always bypasses a VPN. Their recurrence shows that Android’s current
architecture has repeatedly exposed new phone-side bypass paths and cannot
responsibly promise that no further class will appear.

The recommendation is conditional. The phone must use the router as its
exclusive Internet path, with cellular and alternate networks disabled or
separately blocked, and the router must fail closed if its tunnel fails. This
reduces dependence on Android’s VPN enforcement; it is not an unconditional
guarantee against router defects, local-network exposure, or traffic over other
radios.

## 15. Conclusion

The affected class is Android 12+ devices that expose app-visible Wi-Fi NAT-T
keepalive offload with usable unprivileged slots. On such devices, a covered
normal app can reach physical-underlay offload without effective VPN-lockdown
admission. The available runtime, framework, slot, firmware, and shipment
evidence supports exposure across most Android 12+ devices
[25;39].

The repair must separate privileged raw-fd requests from publicUdpEncapsulationSocketrequests. Raw-fd callers requirePACKET_KEEPALIVE_OFFLOAD; public callers require caller-owned resource
validation, fd identity checks, lifetime pinning, and duplicate-use rejection.
Both paths require effective VPN-policy authorization before NetworkAgent or HAL
admission and revalidation when relevant network or VPN state changes. Until
those checks are complete, unprivileged NAT-T offload should fail closed
[11;12].

### A.1 Environment and Boundary Proof

* Primary measured phone: Pixel 8 Pro (husky), Android 16 buildCP1A.260505.005, security patch2026-05-05.
* Independent measured phone: Samsung SM-F966B (q7q) on Qualcomm (qcom)
hardware, Android 16 buildBP4A.251205.006.F966BXXUABZF1, security patch2026-06-05[15].
* Additional active-slot phone: Nothing A059, device and productAsteroids,
boardvolcano, on Qualcomm (qcom) hardware, Android 16 / SDK 36, security
patch2026-06-01, build IDBQ2A.250721.001-BP2A.250605.031.A3[16].
* Later-version provenance: the same non-cumulative snapshot records a Pixel 8
Pro on Android 17 with one active Wi-Fi slot. This row establishes slot
availability only; it does not replace or relabel the controlled Android 16
Pixel packet capture [16].
* VPN configuration: Mullvad packagenet.mullvad.mullvadvpn, version2026.5.
Always-on VPN and “Block connections without VPN” are observed in
VPN-management snapshots for the measured rows.
* App capability: normal app path usingIpSecManager.openUdpEncapsulationSocket()andConnectivityManager.createSocketKeepalive(...). No root, ADB, dangerous
runtime permission, JNI, hidden API, raw Binder, orPACKET_KEEPALIVE_OFFLOADis required for the public-API claim.
* External observation point: separate OpenWrt AP/router capture on the physical
Wi-Fi side. Packets observed there have already crossed Android’s VPN policy
boundary.
* Packet form: fixed NAT-T UDP/4500 keepalive with a one-byte payload. The
primitive cannot carry arbitrary application payloads.
* Cadence and slots: the public minimum interval was observed. On the tested
Pixel Wi-Fi configuration, one unprivileged slot was accepted and later slot
attempts failed withERROR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES (-32). The Samsung row
records one active slot and a measured lease. The Nothing row records one
active slot without a duration measurement.

### A.2 On-Wire Captures, Controls, and Baselines

* Primary Wi-Fi proof: app run20260529-023621-pid20917, router caseslot-cadence, 18 packets, pcap prefixd463ea0c9ea7. Slot 0 accepted and

* Ordinary UDP lockdown control: app run20260529-023925-pid21402, router caseordinary-udp-lockdown, zero matching packets, pcap prefixe3f42e268763.
App-side UDP sends to UDP/4500 and UDP/12345 had no matching router packets
under lockdown.

### A.3 Lifecycle and Boundary Rows

* Nondestructive lifecycle: app runs20260529-013941-pid14044and20260529-021757-pid16937, with lifecycle rows underactive-lifecycle-*.
Background/home, screen lock, force idle, battery saver, restricted bucket,

* Network loss and re-arm: app run20260529-031051-pid12326, router casenetwork-loss-rearm-manual, 6 packets, pcap prefix63a9bec9367f. Wi-Fi loss
causedonError -20; Wi-Fi return and manual re-arm restored the keepalive.
* Back-to-BFU: the Pixel lifecycle observations include GrapheneOS
relock/back-to-BFU-without-reboot continuation; this is not reboot
persistence.

### A.4 Destination Fuzzing

Destination fuzzing tested address-class filtering after keepalive admission.
IPv4 destination classes were broadly accepted and confirmed on-wire; IPv6
behavior was route-driven. These results inform consequence and hardening
analysis. The VPN-lockdown bypass requires only the validated public endpoint.

IPv6 acceptance followed route availability and Java address-family
normalization. With a matching route, especially a::/0default route, 41 of
48 tested IPv6 destination cases were accepted. Missing routes produced
route-selection failures. IPv4-mapped::ffff:*/96forms were rejected withERROR_INVALID_IP_ADDRESS (-21)because Java address parsing normalized them
intoInet4Address, causing a family mismatch. IPv4-translated and NAT64-prefix

### A.5 Diagnostic and Precondition Runs

Android callback and error codes establish preconditions. Only the external
AP/router capture establishes on-wire emission.

Code
Interpretation
0
Accepted callback; external AP/router capture is still required for on-wire proof.
-20
Network lost or keepalive stopped because the active network changed.
-21
Invalid IP, missing route, or address-family mismatch.
-22
Invalid or unbound source port.
-24
Invalid keepalive interval.
-30
Unsupported network type or supported keepalive count zero.
-32
Insufficient resources or slot gate.
-994
Local socket create/bind failure in fuzz app diagnostics.

The second-round fuzz run had 41trial_finishedrows, 40 errors, one skip,
26-32slot-gate results, 9-24interval results, 2-22source-port
results, and 3 local-994socket failures. These counts characterize
negative and precondition runs; they do not establish Wi-Fi destination breadth.

Raw Binder/resource diagnostics used non-null fds with resource IDs including0,-2,Integer.MAX_VALUE, andInteger.MIN_VALUE. Those values were not
treated as ownership proofs. The diagnostics support the authenticity finding;
the VPN-lockdown result uses the documented public API.
