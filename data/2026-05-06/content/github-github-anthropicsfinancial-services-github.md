# Claude for Financial Services

Reference agents, skills, and data connectors for the financial-services workflows we see most — investment banking, equity research, private equity, and wealth management.

Everything here is availabletwo ways from one source: install it as aClaude Coworkplugin, or deploy it through theClaude Managed Agents APIbehind your own workflow engine. Same system prompt, same skills — you choose where it runs.

Important

Nothing in this repository constitutes investment, legal, tax, or accounting advice. These agents draft analyst work product — models, memos, research notes, reconciliations — for review by a qualified professional. They do not make investment recommendations, execute transactions, bind risk, post to a ledger, or approve onboarding; every output is staged for human sign-off. You are responsible for verifying outputs and for compliance with the laws and regulations that apply to your firm.

What's in the repo:

* Agents— named, end-to-end workflow agents (Pitch Agent, Market Researcher, GL Reconciler, …). Each ships as a Cowork pluginandas aClaude Managed Agent templateyou deploy via/v1/agents.
* Vertical plugins— the underlying skills, slash commands, and data connectors, bundled by FSI vertical. Install these on their own if you just want/comps,/dcf,/earningsand the connectors without a full agent.

## Agents

Each agent is named for the workflow it runs. They're starting points: install the ones that match your work, then tune the prompts, skills, and connectors to how your firm does it.

Each agent plugin isself-contained— it bundles the skills it uses, so installing the agent is all you need.

## Getting Started

### Cowork

In Cowork, openSettings → Plugins → Add pluginand either:

* Paste this repo URL—https://github.com/anthropics/claude-for-financial-services— then pick the agents and verticals you want from the marketplace list, or
* Upload a zip— zip any directory underplugins/(e.g.plugins/agent-plugins/pitch-agent/) and drop it in.

### Claude Code

#
 Add the marketplace

claude plugin marketplace add anthropics/claude-for-financial-services

#
 Core skills + connectors (install first)

claude plugin install financial-analysis@claude-for-financial-services

#
 Named agents — pick the ones you want

claude plugin install pitch-agent@claude-for-financial-services
claude plugin install gl-reconciler@claude-for-financial-services
claude plugin install market-researcher@claude-for-financial-services

#
 Vertical skill bundles

claude plugin install investment-banking@claude-for-financial-services
claude plugin install equity-research@claude-for-financial-services

Once installed, agents appear in Cowork dispatch, skills fire automatically when relevant, and slash commands are available in your session (/comps,/dcf,/earnings,/ic-memo, …).

### Claude Managed Agents

export
 ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
scripts/deploy-managed-agent.sh gl-reconciler

Each template undermanaged-agent-cookbooks/references the same system prompt and skills as its plugin counterpart. The deploy script resolves file references, uploads skills, creates leaf-worker subagents, and POSTs the orchestrator to/v1/agents. Seescripts/orchestrate.pyfor a reference event loop that routeshandoff_requestevents between agents via your own orchestration layer.

Research Preview:subagent delegation (callable_agents) is a preview capability. See per-agent READMEs for security and handoff guidance.

## How It Fits Together

What it is

Where it lives

Agents

Self-contained plugins that own a workflow end to end — system prompt plus the skills it uses. Cowork and the Managed Agent wrapper both reference the same directory.

plugins/agent-plugins/<slug>/

Skills

Domain expertise, conventions, and step-by-step methods Claude draws on automatically when relevant. Authored once in the verticals; each agent bundles a synced copy of the ones it needs.

plugins/vertical-plugins/<vertical>/skills/
 (source) · 
plugins/agent-plugins/<slug>/skills/
 (bundled)

Commands

Slash actions you trigger explicitly (
/comps
, 
/earnings
, 
/ic-memo
).

plugins/vertical-plugins/<vertical>/commands/

Connectors

MCP servers
 that wire Claude to your data — terminals, research platforms, document stores.

plugins/vertical-plugins/financial-analysis/.mcp.json

Managed-agent wrappers

agent.yaml
 + depth-1 subagents + steering examples for headless deployment.

managed-agent-cookbooks/<slug>/

Everything is file-based — markdown and JSON, no build step.

## Claude for Microsoft 365 — Install Tooling

If your firm runs Claude inside Excel, PowerPoint, Word, and Outlook via the Microsoft 365 add-in,claude-for-msft-365-install/is the admin tooling to provision it againstyour own cloud— Vertex AI, Bedrock, or an internal LLM gateway — instead of Anthropic's API.

It's a Claude Code plugin (not a Cowork plugin) that walks an IT admin through generating the customized add-in manifest, granting Azure admin consent, and writing per-user routing config via Microsoft Graph. Install with:

claude plugin install claude-for-msft-365-install@claude-for-financial-services
/claude-for-msft-365-install:setup

This is separate from the agents and vertical plugins above — it's the on-ramp that gets the add-in deployed in a tenant, after which the agents and skills here are what runs inside it.

## Making It Yours

These are reference templates — they get better when you tune them to how your firm works.

* Swap connectors— point.mcp.jsonat your data providers and internal systems.
* Add firm context— drop your terminology, processes, and formatting standards into skill files.
* Bring your templates—/ppt-templateteaches Claude your branded PowerPoint layouts.
* Adjust agent scope— editagents/<slug>.mdto match how your team actually runs the workflow.
* Add your own— copy the structure for workflows we haven't covered.

## Contributing

Everything here is markdown and YAML. Fork, edit, PR. For new content:

* New skill → add it underplugins/vertical-plugins/<vertical>/skills/, then runpython3 scripts/sync-agent-skills.pyto propagate to any agent that bundles it.
* New agent →plugins/agent-plugins/<slug>/(withagents/<slug>.md+skills/) and a matchingmanaged-agent-cookbooks/<slug>/.
* Runpython3 scripts/check.pybefore pushing — it lints every manifest, verifies all cross-file references resolve, and fails if any bundled skill has drifted from its vertical source.
