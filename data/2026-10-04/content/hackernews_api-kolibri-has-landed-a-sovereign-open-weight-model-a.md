# Kolibri Has Landed: A Sovereign Open-Weight Model

On the Day of German Reunification, we are releasing our new model: Kolibri.

Kolibri is an English-German Mixture-of-Experts Transformer with 78B total parameters, 3B
 active. It supports context lengths of up to 1M tokens. The model can be downloaded with the
 full weights onHugging Faceand used under the Apache 2.0 license terms.

Kolibri is the result of continuous iteration of our model training effort. We first builta model training pipelineand validated it by building Kolibri Origin, a 30B total, 3B active model with a much shorter
 65k token context window. Kolibri ran through the same pipeline: from data ingestion and curation,
 through ablations, pre-training, and post-training, to the final evals. It enabled running hundreds
 of ablation experiments and stable pre-training that ran without a person having to step in when
 hardware failed or a data connection dropped. We continuously monitored training metrics and standardized
 monitoring for custom benchmarks. The time we put into building and iterating on this pipeline
 was a valuable investment. We see it in how much better Kolibri is than Kolibri Origin, and in
 how little time separates their releases.

Kolibri is a specialized language model built for sovereign mission-critical work in
 regulated areas including public administration, industrials and aerospace. We specialized
 Kolibri for German, reasoning, math, agentic behavior, and further capabilities our
 customers need in production. The aim of this specialization was to optimize performance in
 our customers' specific use cases. Through specialization, customers achieve contextualized
 performance in their AI operations and they can monitor its economic impact, so that ROI
 stays measurable and grows over time.

Specialization alone is not enough. Sovereignty is just as important. Sovereignty, for us,
 combines two dimensions: how we built the model, and how it transfers to our customers. We
 offer full supply-chain integrity and account for every decision, from data ingestion,
 through pre- and post-training, to the final evaluations. We provide transparency. Customers
 have full freedom of deployment and intellectual-property safety, so compliance comes as an
 inherited property of the model.

## What Kolibri Delivers

We optimized Kolibri for performance across a wide range of sectors considering their
 particular domain-specific language, regulatory, and procedural realities. Its small and
 efficient size provides our customers with flexibility to run it efficiently on-premise,
 without sending internal data to third-party inference services. The spotlight in this
 section introduces the model's capabilities, before we describe them in sectionHow we built Kolibri at high velocity.

### Foundational capabilities for enterprise and government

With Kolibri we optimize the trade-off between model capability and deployment costs, using
 3B active parameters out of 78B total. Kolibri sits on the Pareto frontier for quality
 versus serving cost, for both English and German. The Pareto frontier is a concept from
 economics, marking the best achievable combinations of two objectives, where improving on
 one means giving up some of the other. None of the compared models delivers more quality at
 the same serving cost, or the same quality at lower cost.

Foundational capabilities of Kolibri.
 Kolibri is a balanced generalist model with competitive performance across math, code, long context, agentic capabilities, and knowledge. Benchmark scores are shown on a shared 0–100 scale, higher is better.

### Contextualized performance for real-world applications

Public benchmarks fail to capture specialized sector needs, so we developed our own internal
 evaluation suites for the verticals that matter to our customers, such as the German public
 sector, aviation, manufacturing and the automotive industry. Each suite mirrors the skills,
 workflows, and edge cases required in these sectors, and paired synthetic training
 environments let us improve Kolibri against these evaluations without ever training on
 customer data. Read more in sectionContextualized performance.

Answers that are grounded in your documents.We trained Kolibri with abstention
 data and with our Merlin-Arthur protocol. As a result, it is trained to say "I don't know" when
 the answer isn't in the context. Our customers value and request this feature, so we continuously
 track and validate abstention accuracy. We provide more details in theGroundingsection.

Native German and English model.We developed a bilingual German/English tokenizer
 and focused onincluding organic German datathroughout the training process of the model, so that 21.3% of the pre-training tokens are German.
 We used translation sparingly (6% overall), since translated text tends to carry the cultural
 fingerprint of its source language. The result is a model that is bilingual by design, not an
 English model that has read some German. Read more in sectionsGerman pre-training dataandSpecialized tokenizers.

### Control and compliance by design: upholding our customers' sovereignty

We built Kolibri with the EU AI Act, theGeneral-Purpose AI Code of Practiceand the GDPR in mind from the ground up, with copyright law being a focus of our work to trustworthy
 technology.

We aretransparentabout ourmodel weightsand aboutcuration of our training data, so that decisions behind development are visible. Through its reasoning traces, it
 becomesexplainablehow the model came to a particular answer. With ourMerlin-Arthur protocolthe model groundstrustworthiness: Kolibri refrains from answering when
 the context doesn't support an answer.

Our teams built the model in Germany, trained it on infrastructure in Germany and Finland,
 under European and German law, with no foreigncontrol. We own the entire
 pipeline, from data curation, through pre- and post-training, to optimization in our Model
 Factory. This control of our end to end pipeline underpins the model's sovereignty. Control
 also passes on to our customers and Kolibri's small size gives them full freedom of
 deployment and supports controllable reasoning effort to trade cost and latency against
 answer quality.

## How We Built Kolibri at High Velocity

### Our Model Factory: two models, three months apart

Our Model Factory is our answer to iteration speed, minimizing the time it takes to go from
 knowing what a model gets wrong to training one that does better. We implemented the
 training pipeline as code, so that the learnings of our team landed in one versioned
 training recipe instead of scattered scripts and notes. Here is what that looked like
 between Kolibri Origin and Kolibri.

Work on the pipeline began in January. Five months and hundreds of ablation runs later,
 Kolibri Origin finished pre-training at target scale on 11 June. Kolibri finished on 11
 September. In the three months between those two dates we went from 30B parameters to 78B,
 from a 65k-token context window to up to 1M, and from 7.5T training tokens to 20T. To get
 those 20T, the pipeline processed over 200T tokens of raw data, filtering, deduplicating,
 and curating it down to what we actually trained on. We changed the attention design,
 tripled the number of experts, increased sparsity, replaced the routing algorithm, improved
 our post-training data, more than doubled the number of environment tasks, and taught the
 model to reason at four different effort levels. Both models kept a similar number of
 parameters active per token, yet Kolibri trained faster per token than Kolibri Origin thanks
 to the work of our efficiency team.

What made this possible is our training pipeline, an effort to convert research-grade model
 development into a fully automated production-ready infrastructure to design and train large
 language models.Our pipeline codebase was shared by all. Every proposed code change triggers a small end-to-end model run; training, evaluation,
 to find out if something broke within minutes. Our runs are GitHub Actions workflows, and
 reproducing one means checking out a commit. We used the pipeline for the main training and
 the hundreds of ablations that ran to make our architectures and data-mix decisions.

Training checkpoints land roughly every hour and the pipeline automatically evaluates them
 on English and German knowledge, maths, code, instruction following, tool use, long context,
 safety, abstention to hallucination and grounding. We can watch capabilities appear every
 day rather than finding out how the model turned out at the end. The run itself held up
 better than we expected. Over 21 days of pre-training of Kolibri, we hit 38 unplanned
 interruptions, roughly one per 10,000 GPU-hours, caused by hardware faults or a connection
 timing out. Those were automatically handled by the pipeline without manual intervention.
 The cluster automatically restarted the training job(s) on a different set of nodes, and
 training picked up from a checkpoint at most 250 steps back.

Having access to the whole pipeline, with checkpoints available to everyone, means that any
 team can own a capability end to end rather than a stage of an assembly line. One team
 trained and evaluated the grounding capability of Kolibri as a single piece of work,
 seamlessly integrating into the overall model.

However, getting here was not a linear walk. We stumbled. We stopped the Kolibri Origin
 pre-training after a few trillion tokens and restarted it from scratch, as we identified a
 data-shuffling bug that escaped our tests. We ran ablations, took decisions, only to find a
 bug or an error in the configuration afterwards, forcing us to rerun some experiments.
 Alongside our own experience, we tracked state-of-the-art architectures, best practices, and
 the latest research advances in LLMs. Those accumulated learnings led to improvements in our
 processes and guardrails in our pipeline.

Looking at the delta between Kolibri Origin and Kolibri, the improvement is notable, but
 this is also the easy direction: more parameters, more data, a well-understood architecture
 family, and still at small scale. As we are contemplating scaling up, we are happy to face
 challenges on our foundation. But the most durable thing we built this year is not the
 pipeline, it is a team with the proven capability to build, post-train, and ship LLMs from
 raw data at high velocity.

### Architecture and pre-training

Kolibri has 78B total parameters, which is 2.5 times more than Kolibri Origin, with ~3B
 active parameters. In our experiments, increasing the size of our model from 32B to 123B led
 to ever-improved performance. Yet the larger size came with larger training and serving
 costs. The latter drove the decision: 123B can handle only 3 long-context 256k-token user
 queries on two H100s, while 78B handles 18 concurrent requests and decodes 28% faster. We
 used 384 smaller experts rather than fewer wide ones, as they performed better in our tests.
 We applied the same efficiency-first reasoning to attention. Out of 50 total layers, only 10
 process full context, while the remaining 40 use a tight 512-token focused window. This
 keeps decode computation and memory bounded in those layers regardless of context length.
 The efficiency gains benefit both serving the trained model and training during
 post-training RL, which relies on huge amounts of inference.

We trained Kolibri on768 B200 GPUsin three stages: 20T tokens of pre-training at a 16k sequence length over 21 days, 3.44T tokens
 of mid-training at 64k, and 200B tokens of long-context adaptation at 256k. This is nearly 24T
 tokens in total, roughly three times what Kolibri Origin consumed. German accounts for more than
 a fifth of the pre-training mix, about 4.3T tokens, against roughly 62% English and 14% code.
 Compared to pre-training, mid-training data is a much more selective pool of curated datasets
 weighted toward reasoning, problem-solving, code and agentic data. For long-context, rather than
 train on long documents alone, which tends to erode the skills acquired earlier, we interleaved
 long documents with the high-quality mid-training data of the previous stage. For the long-context
 mix, we removed synthetic long documents to avoid artificially inflating benchmarks such as RULER.

We optimized with Muon, as we did for Kolibri Origin. We put special focus on training
 stability, resulting in a robust training run without any loss spikes for either model. With
 Kolibri, for routing between experts during training, we introduce exact quantile balancing.
 Quantile balancing was introduced in Kimi K3, where the global quantile is estimated from
 histograms because an exact computation was considered too expensive to communicate; we show
 that it can be computed exactly at fixed cost independent of batch size, and that the
 exactness improves both load balance and model quality.

### Post-training at scale

Post-training happened in two stages; the first step is supervised fine-tuning to teach the
 model core reasoning ability and how to interact in a chat, followed by large-scale
 reinforcement learning to train the model to reason across a diverse suite of long-horizon
 tasks. We built a pipeline for both of these steps, which allowed us to exercise
 fine-grained control over the behavior of the model.

For SFT we generated a total of 174B tokens worth of synthetic data, which we filtered for
 quality and combined with filtered versions of permissively licensed open-source datasets to
 obtain a high-quality training mix of 268B tokens. For reinforcement learning we trained on
 a broad set of environments that contained more than 1.2 million curated tasks across
 diverse domains such as code & math reasoning, agentic tasks, instruction following,
 question answering, tool calling, and more. We optimized our in-house training codebase for
 high-performance and use asynchronous training, where we generate training data on our
 environments using the current model in parallel to training the model on already generated
 data.

Across both stages, we taught the model to reason at different effort levels (none, low,
 medium, high), which means that the user can exercise control over how much compute the
 model should invest to find a solution to the task at hand. This allows our customers to
 trade-off cost and inference speed against the quality of the final answer.

### German pre-training data

From our experiments on small proxy models, we found that training with around 20% German
 data leads to optimal results, which meant we needed to find 4T German tokens to train our
 model at a 20T horizon. Open German datasets help, but are far from enough: after
 deduplication and filtering, we were left with 390B German tokens, well short of our goal.
 As we argued inSauerkraut, Not Burgers, German capability has to come from high-quality German texts; relying heavily on
 machine-translations would lead to poor results due to subtle translation errors and a lack
 of authentic German cultural context. We closed the token gap in three different ways.

The first was to curate German from Common Crawl ourselves. We built a pipeline specialized
 for German data. German is not English, and German data cannot be filtered like English
 data: we had to retune filtering parameters for the German language. One typical filter in a
 language data pipeline is to remove documents with too many long words, but German
 administrative prose routinely exceeds the English bound on mean word length, so the
 standard settings quietly remove the register that public administration writes in. After
 retuning, our German pipeline gave us 1.3T unique tokens of organic German web.

The second was to rephrase German documents we already had. An LLM rewrites an organic
 German document in the style of an encyclopedia entry, a Q&A dialogue or a text passage,
 preserving its content. This teaches the model the same facts in several surface forms and
 multiplies the information contained in scarce data, and it is a different operation from
 translation: the source is German, so the subject matter and the cultural affinity stay
 German: chancellor, not president. It does not add much new knowledge, rather new phrasings
 of knowledge that was already in the corpus. Rephrasing gave us about 1T unique tokens,
 making it the single largest source of German in the model.

The third was translation, and this we only used in Kolibri Origin. Translating English into
 German works when the model, the prompts and the chunking are chosen carefully, but it
 carries two problems. Output can still show translationese, the literal rendering of idioms:
 "Drive safe!" becomes "Fahre sicher!" rather than "Komm gut an!". More importantly, cultural
 context does not translate. A corpus translated from English inherits the geographic,
 demographic and institutional distribution of the English web, so a model trained on it
 speaks German about a world that looks American.

In the end German entered Kolibri as a 2.4T-token unique pool, 80% of it curated or
 generated by us and 20% from open datasets, and the model saw it at 21.3% of pre-training
 tokens, roughly 4.3T over the 20T run through upsampling. Each German token was seen 1.8
 times on average, well inside the four-epoch limit past which repetition stops paying off.
 Around 85% of the German the model read is web text, either organic or rephrased from
 organic. The rest is curated documents – parliamentary proceedings, legal texts and other
 data in the public domain – and that small translated share.

### Specialized tokenizers for English-German

We built a bilingual English-German tokenizer, trained and specialized on each model's
 pre-training dataset. Because of the 21% German share in our data, it compresses German
 language better than other SOTA models. This led to more efficient inference (fewer tokens)
 minimizing costs and shortening response times. We introduce a new way to train tokenizers,
 UniBPE, that respects the morphology of languages better than existing approaches,
 especially the compound structure of German, without sacrificing English token efficiency.

Tokenizer compression in average bytes per token on German and English web text. Kolibri achieves the best German compression in this comparison. Plain BPE 128k is standard BPE trained on the same data with the same settings as Kolibri, which isolates the effect of the training method. More text per token means fewer tokens per task – higher is better.

The two leading approaches to train tokenizers areBPEandUnigram. We combine those two, keeping
 the bottom-up approach of BPE and using the Unigram training objective for selecting which
 merge to add to the vocabulary. On a 128k vocabulary trained on our English/German dataset,
 this substantially improves tokenization.

How different tokenizers split the same words. The Kolibri tokenizer follows the morphology of the language. English and German words split into meaningful units, while competitors cut across morpheme boundaries. Lower is better: fewer, cleaner splits per word mean fewer tokens.

### Grounding: reducing hallucinations

Common LLM training and evaluation rewards guessing: a guess has some chance of landing the
 correct answer, while abstention has none. Therefore, models learn to answer with whatever
 they have, even if their input does not provide enough information to warrant a response.
 Asking a model to provide citations often backfires for the same reason: models can simply
 hallucinate plausible-looking sources to justify an ungrounded answer.

For a regulated customer, a model that knows to abstain is the difference between a pilot
 and a deployment. We treat saying "I don't know" as an important model capability and (1)
 develop and track dedicated grounding and anti-hallucination measures and (2) use and
 develop dedicated training procedures to improve this abstention capability.

During training, we use training data samples where the correct answer is "I don't know".
 While fine-tuning for abstention is gaining traction industry-wide, high-quality negative
 examples remain hard to come by, especially where our customers need them, in narrow
 verticals where all data is scarce. Therefore, we also train with ourMerlin-Arthurprocedure, developed in-house and explained in detail inour blog post, which solves data scarcity by automatically exploiting the model's weaknesses at each
 training step and generates synthetic negative examples from available documents. This
 training becomes a game with three players. Arthur is the model we train and ship. Merlin
 takes an existing document context, generates a new one that increases Arthur's probability
 of answering correctly. Morgana generates a new datapoint by stripping out the relevant
 evidence from the document and tries to lure Arthur into a hallucination. Arthur does not
 know which one he's facing, so his valid strategy becomes to carefully read the question and
 the context, to be able to answer on Merlin's context, while recognizing that abstention is
 the strictly required answer for Morgana's redacted context – making any guess, even a lucky
 one, incorrect.

For measuring hallucination abstention, we use established benchmarks alongside our own
 proxies derived from customer use cases. We've also developed our own "M/A grounding score"
 which falls out of our Merlin-Arthur setup representing a lower bound on how much of the
 answer provably came from the document.

Kolibri hallucinates far less than Kolibri Origin: it abstains instead of answering wrong on
 44% ofAA-Omniscienceitems (Origin: 15%), and onRGBit holds back
 more often (86% vs 74%) and invents fewer falsehoods (87% vs 76%). On our ownM/A grounding score, which certifies rather than estimates how much of an answer came from the document,
 Kolibri reaches 0.23 where Kolibri Origin, along some other models, reach 0.

### Contextualized performance

Most public benchmarks fail to capture specialized sector needs. To measure contextualized
 performance – meaning how well a model handles the unique workflows and domain knowledge of
 specific industries – we need measurements of performance in specialized verticals which are
 important to our customers, such as the German public sector, legal, hardware, consumer
 electronics, and automotive.

For this, we first built domain-specific evaluation suites that mirror the skills,
 tool-calls, workflows, and edge cases required in key sectors and thus capture
 contextualized performance. Once this was done, we created training environments by
 generating high-quality specialized synthetic data capturing those required skills. To
 increase the real-world robustness of the model on those tasks, we additionally randomized
 the environments around concrete details (tools, configurations, harnesses).

Together, these contributed to an iterative engine that allowed us to sharpen the model's
 agentic RAG capabilities, domain-specific logic and capabilities, and to hill-climb the
 contextualized evaluations without ever training on customer data.

These evaluation suites run automatically as part of our pipeline: every checkpoint is
 scored on them as it lands. Kolibri compares well against competing open-weight models. On
 the agentic-RAG benchmark Honeypot, Kolibri outperforms all compared models, including the
 much larger Nemotron 3 Super and Mistral Small 4. On a cleaned version of the agentic-RAG
 benchmark MuSiQue, it is second only to the more massive Nemotron 3 Super and well ahead of
 the rest. On the five customer applications, Kolibri leads or is on par with the best model
 in four of five. These findings speak to our ability to handle a range of data and harness
 setups, across use-cases, whereas the compared models are sensitive to these details.

These evaluations for measuring contextualized performance can exist because customers tell
 us how their applications fall short. Each one encodes what we learned from those
 conversations: what kind of documents matter, which tools the model should get, which
 questions are hard, where the deployed system frustrates its users today. That makes the
 exchange concrete in both directions. A customer who shows us a failure case gets it turned
 into a benchmark that every future checkpoint is measured against, and we can hill-climb the
 target without ever training on customer data or risking over-fitting.

## Get Started

Our model is available openly onHugging Faceunder an Apache 2.0 License.

Kolibri requires thealeph-alpha-inferencepackage that provides the Kolibri
 vLLM plugin. You can either use the provided container imageghcr.io/aleph-alpha/aleph-alpha-inference, or install the package fromAleph-Alpha/aleph-alpha-inference, which also installs the vLLM version it supports:

pip
 install
 "aleph-alpha-inference>=1.0"

Serve the model with reasoning and tool-calling enabled.

vllm
 serve
 Aleph-Alpha/Kolibri-1
 --kv-cache-dtype
 fp8
 \

 --reasoning-parser
 kolibri1
 \

 --tool-call-parser
 kolibri1
 \

 --enable-auto-tool-choice

To serve contexts beyond 262,144 tokens, add--max-model-len 1048576 --hf-overrides '{"max_position_embeddings": 1048576}'. The recommended sampling parameters for the model aretemperature=1.0,top_p=0.97andtop_k=128.
