# Guardian

Architecture Enforcement Framework for AI-Assisted Development

Guardian turns software architecture into executable constraints. Instead of relying on documentation, code reviews, and tribal knowledge to prevent architectural drift, Guardian continuously verifies that implementations conform to architectural decisions throughout development.

It does not analyze architecture once. It integrates with development workflows so every implementation, issue, pull request, and merge is validated against architectural constraints. Violations become CI failures rather than documentation comments.

For example, if the architecture specifies that the Payment context may not depend on Authentication, Guardian detects the dependency during CI and blocks the change before merge.

## How It Works

Guardian centers on a single.pi/directory — the architectural source of truth. From this model it generates the concrete artifacts that enforce architecture across the full development lifecycle:

Artifact

What It Generates

Architecture specifications

Module boundaries, component breakdowns, dependency rules, interface contracts

Architecture Decision Records

Structured ADR documents with status tracking and cross-references

Implementation epics

Component-level issues sliced from architecture modules, ordered by dependency

CI enforcement policies

Validator scripts, hardening stages, and merge gates that block violations

Agent workflows

21 prompt templates covering feature development, bug fixes, hotfixes, refactoring, and issue lifecycle

Tool-specific exports

.claude/
, 
.github/
, 
.opencode/
, 
.agents/
 directories generated from the same 
.pi/
 source

The.pi/model also supports domain modeling with concepts like bounded contexts, entities, and domain events for teams that use those techniques. For everyone else, it works directly from architecture modules and ADRs — no DDD background required.

## Enforcement Through CI

Guardian enforces architecture through 7 categories of validator scripts, automatically selected based on change scope:

Scope

Files

Lines

Validators Triggered

Simple

1-2

<= 50

CI + canonical

Moderate

3-5

51-200

CI + architecture + canonical

Complex

6-15

201-500

CI + architecture + security + tests + integration + canonical

Critical

16+

501+

All 7 + human approval

Each validator runs as a shell script during CI. Failures block the merge:

Validator

What It Checks

Runs At

CI

Build, test, lint, format, audit

All changes

Architecture

Module boundaries, dependency direction, ADR compliance

Moderate+

Canonical

Every code file references its architecture source; docs match code

All changes

Security

Secrets, injection, path traversal, auth bypass

Complex+

Tests

Unit, integration, coverage thresholds

Complex+

Integration

Component wiring, interface contracts

Complex+

Operations

Tracing, cancellation, atomic writes, error handling

Critical

The canonical validator is the linchpin: every implementation file carries a header tracing it to a specific architecture section. When code and architecture diverge, the reference breaks and CI fails.

/**

 * Canonical Reference: .pi/architecture/modules/auth-system.md#token-validation

 * Implements: AC-1, AC-2

 * Issue: #42

 * Last Sync: 2026-06-28

 */

## Proven in Practice

Guardian was used to buildRigorix— a deterministic coding-agent runtime comprising 146,312 lines of Rust across 30 modules, 3 crates, and 580 commits — written by a single developer over 11 active days.

During that build:

* 18 ADRs defined the architecture
* 38 module specs described component contracts
* 44 issue drafts drove implementation across 120+ feature branches
* 7 validator scripts ran on every merge
* Architecture violations were detected in CI, reducing reliance on manual code review

Rigorixserves as the public reference implementation demonstrating Guardian's workflow in practice. The architecture defined in.pi/was continuously validated against implementation — divergence was detected automatically before it reached the main branch.

## Installation

#
 CLI tool — scaffold in any project

npx guardian-framework init
npm install -g guardian-framework

Pi package— load extensions, skills, and prompts directly into apisession:

pi install npm:guardian-framework

This makes all Guardian slash commands (/architect,/pipeline,/goal,/domain, etc.) available inside pi without runningguardian initfirst. Run/guardian-statusafter install to check availability.

Prerequisites:Bun>= 1.0.0

## Quick Start

### 1. Scaffold the framework

cd
 your-project
npx guardian-framework init

Interactive prompts for project name, language, AI tools, validators, and workflows.

### 2. Define your architecture

Architecture modules in.pi/architecture/modules/define components, dependencies, and status:

# 
Auth System

## 
JWT Token Validation

status: planned
description: Validates JWT tokens — expiry, signature, claims.
depends: none

## 
OAuth2 Provider Integration

status: planned
description: Google, GitHub OAuth2 for SSO.
depends: JWT Token Validation

### 3. Generate the project from architecture

guardian project create --lang java --buildTool maven --groupId com.mycompany

Generates source tree, build config, and CI pipeline with enforcement pre-wired.

### 4. Plan and implement

/architect --epic "Auth Module v1" # Creates issues from architecture modules
/epic-plan --module auth docs/auth.md # Module-specific slice

### 5. Validate

bash .pi/scripts/validate-ci.sh
bash .pi/scripts/validate-canonical.sh
guardian validate 
#
 TOML-based declarative validators

### 6. Update and export

guardian update --dryRun 
#
 Preview framework changes

#

## Token Optimization

Guardian includes several mechanisms to reduce token consumption when working with LLM-based coding agents:

Mechanism

How It Works

DRY Context

Shared templates loaded once per session rather than per-turn

Snippet Expansion

#handle
 tokens expand to full content on demand

TOML Filters

8-stage filter pipeline compresses command output before sending to LLM

Validator Scripts

Shell scripts replace LLM-based checks for mechanical validations

Context Compaction

Budget-aware truncation prioritizing structurally important lines

Token tracking with USD estimation is available viaguardian stats.
