Distinguished Engineer
 

Before television shows likeThe OfficeandParks and Recreationcemented the mockumentary in the minds of millions, there was Christopher Guest. He didn’t invent the genre, but he’s widely recognized as one of its most influential practitioners, and for my money, there’s none better. I’ve watchedWaiting for GuffmanandBest in Showmore times than I can count. But the one that has stuck with me the most, the one I quote at the slightest provocation, isThis Is Spinal Tap.

If you’ve seen it you already know where this is going (and if you haven’t, you now have weekend plans). The film is a fictional documentary about an aging English rock band named Spinal Tap, whose members are everything we picture when we picture over-the-top rock stars. In one of its more memorable scenes, the guitarist (Nigel) gives the filmmaker (Marty) a tour of his most prized gear, in particular showing off an amplifier unlike any other: its dials don’t stop at ten. That leads to what might be the single most quoted exchange in the entire movie:

Nigel:“You see, most blokes, you know, will be playing at ten. You’re on ten here, all the way up, all the way up, all the way up, you’re on ten on your guitar. Where can you go from there? Where?”

Marty:“I don’t know.”

Nigel:“Nowhere. Exactly. What we do is, if we need that extra push over the cliff, you know what we do?”

Marty:“Put it up to eleven?”

Nigel:“Eleven. Exactly. One louder.”

This is .NET 11. It’s one louder, with another year’s worth of performance work
having gone into making the runtime and libraries that much faster. Of course, the premise of Nigel’s special amplifier is ludicrous, as is exemplified in the subsequent few lines of dialog:

Marty:“Why don’t you just make ten louder and make ten be the top number and make that a little louder?”

Nigel:(pauses) “…these go to eleven.”

In contrast, .NET 11 is actually one higher, one louder. The sections that follow are full of real improvements. A bounds check removed, an allocation that no longer happens, a lock that isn’t taken, a loop that runs in fewer cycles than it did a year ago, a comparison folded to a constant here, a redundant check hoisted out of a loop there, a couple of instructions fused into one, a syscall sidestepped, an array copy handed off to SIMD, and on and on. That’s how real performance work goes, accumulating gain after gain, each compounding on the last, until the whole thing is measurably, provably louder. And so, in this post, as I’ve done in past years with.NET 10,.NET 9,.NET 8,.NET 7,.NET 6,.NET 5,.NET Core 3.0,.NET Core 2.1, and.NET Core 2.0before it, we’ll take an unhurried tour through hundreds of them.

This is a long one. It’s meant to be. Grab your hot beverage of choice, settle in, and let’s turn it up.

## Benchmarking Setup

As in previous years, the post is chock full of micro-benchmarks that demonstrate the individual improvements. Almost all of them useBenchmarkDotNet, and each is written to be self-contained so you can try it out yourself.

Start by ensuring you have both.NET 10and.NET 11installed (most of the benchmarks compare the same code running on both versions) and create a new console project in a freshbenchmarksdirectory:

dotnet new console -o benchmarks
cd benchmarks

Replace the contents of the generatedbenchmarks.csprojwith the following, which multi-targets both versions so that BenchmarkDotNet can build for each:

<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

 <PropertyGroup>
 <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
 <TargetFrameworks>net11.0;net10.0</TargetFrameworks>
 <LangVersion>preview</LangVersion>
 <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
 <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
 <AllowUnsafeBlocks>true</AllowUnsafeBlocks>
 <ServerGarbageCollection>true</ServerGarbageCollection>
 <SystemPackageVersion Condition="'$(TargetFramework)' == 'net10.0'">10.0.12</SystemPackageVersion>
 <SystemPackageVersion Condition="'$(TargetFramework)' == 'net11.0'">11.0.0-rc.1.26425.128</SystemPackageVersion>
 </PropertyGroup>

 <ItemGroup>
 <PackageReference Include="BenchmarkDotNet" Version="0.16.0-preview.1" />
 <PackageReference Include="System.IO.Hashing" Version="$(SystemPackageVersion)" />
 <PackageReference Include="System.Runtime.Caching" Version="$(SystemPackageVersion)" />
 <PackageReference Include="System.Numerics.Tensors" Version="$(SystemPackageVersion)" />
 </ItemGroup>

</Project>

For a given benchmark to test, copy its complete contents over everything inProgram.csand then run it. Each benchmark includes as a comment at the top the exact command to use. In most cases, it’s:

dotnet run -c Release -f net10.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net10.0 net11.0

which builds in Release and runs the benchmark against both .NET 10 and .NET 11, emitting a side-by-side comparison. The other common form, used when a benchmark is comparing two coding approaches on a single runtime (rather than the same code across two runtimes) is:

dotnet run -c Release -f net11.0 --filter "*"

The usual disclaimer applies: these are micro-benchmarks, many measuring operations so short that a blink would miss them. Your results will vary with your hardware, OS, runtime configuration, what else your machine happens to be doing at that exact moment, and whether Mercury is in retrograde.

Every line of managed code ultimately ends up at the just-in-time compiler, so let’s start there.

## JIT

Of all the places to improve .NET’s performance, few have as broad an impact as the just-in-time (JIT) compiler. C#, F#, and Visual Basic are typically compiled first to intermediate language (IL), and the JIT ultimately turns that IL into the native instructions the CPU executes. A JIT improvement can therefore benefit application and library code wherever the optimized pattern occurs, often with no source changes or recompilation of the application itself. Even removing a single instruction or proving one check unnecessary can add up when the code is on a very hot path.

### Deabstraction

We as developers love our abstractions. They let us write clean, reusable, object-oriented code, but we don’t want to pay for every abstraction at run time. The runtime can often undo an abstraction when it proves the effects aren’t observable. It can look at a virtual call and determine which concrete method it’ll invoke, look at a heap allocation and recognize that the object never leaves the current stack frame, or look at an interface cast and reuse a type fact already established earlier in the method. This process is called “deabstraction.” .NET has improved steadily in this area for years, and that continues in .NET 11.

Every time you writeinterfacein C#, you’re creating a contract, a promise that any type implementing that interface can be substituted for any other. That flexibility is enormously valuable because, for example, it’s what lets us writeIEnumerable<T>and have it work equally well over arrays, lists, other collections, LINQ, custom iterators, and so on. But the CPU doesn’t know anything about these contracts; it just knows how to execute instructions. Turning “call whatever method this interface reference points to” into actual machine instructions requires special machinery. Consider this example:

// dotnet run -c Release -f net11.0 --filter "*"

using BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes;
using BenchmarkDotNet.Running;
using System.Runtime.CompilerServices;

BenchmarkSwitcher.FromAssembly(typeof(Benchmarks).Assembly).Run(args);

[DisassemblyDiagnoser, HideColumns("Job", "Error", "StdDev", "Median", "RatioSD")]
public class Benchmarks
{
 private Animal _animal = Environment.TickCount >= 0 ? new Dog() : new Cat();

 [Benchmark]
 public int Speak() => _animal.Speak();

 public abstract class Animal
 {
 public abstract int Speak();
 }

 private sealed class Dog : Animal
 {
 [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]
 public override int Speak() => 1;
 }

 private sealed class Cat : Animal
 {
 [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]
 public override int Speak() => 2;
 }
}

At compile time, all else equal, the JIT doesn’t know whether_animalis aDogor aCat. It generates code that loads the instance’s “method table pointer” (its object type handle), sometimes called a “vtable pointer”, stored at the beginning of every .NET object, indexes into the method table at the known slot forSpeak, and calls the function pointer found there:

; x64
mov rcx, [rcx+8] ; load _animal
mov rax, [rcx] ; load method table
mov rax, [rax+40] ; load vtable chunk
call qword ptr [rax+20]

For this one call toSpeak, we pay three dependent memory dereferences and an indirect call because the processor doesn’t know for certain in advance where the call is going (it might guess, or “speculatively execute”, but it has to be prepared for the possibility it was wrong), and because the call target is indirect, the JIT can’t inline the callee. WhateverSpeakdoes, its code can’t be folded into the calling method.

That’s a performance problem. Those indirections have overhead, but the bigger cost is the lost opportunity to inline. Inlining not only saves function call overhead, more importantly it opens the callee’s code up to the same optimizations that are operating on the caller, such as constant propagation, dead code elimination, bounds check elimination, further devirtualization, etc. That means a series of small virtual calls that each look innocent can, when devirtualized and inlined, collapse into a handful of instructions that would be unrecognizable and way cheaper when compared to the original source code. Without inlining, each callee is an opaque box; with it, the JIT can see through the layers.

We as .NET developers constantly rely on the JIT’s sophisticated heuristics for inlining that weigh the IL size of the callee, the exact work the callee is performing, the call frequency of the method, the expected benefit from constant arguments, and dozens of other factors. For virtual calls, the JIT needs to know what the actual target of the call will be; it needs to “devirtualize”. In some cases, it can determine that statically, where it has exact-type knowledge. For example, if the JIT can prove thatanimalis always aDog, whether because it was just allocated withnew Dog():

Animal animal = GetSomeAnimal();
animal.Speak();
...
static Animal GetSomeAnimal() => new Dog(); // inlineable

or because the variable’s type is a sealed class:

Dog animal = GetSomeAnimal();
animal.Speak();
...
sealed class Dog { ... } // impossible for `animal` to be anything other than a `Dog`

or with NativeAOT and whole-program compilation, if it sees thatAnimalis abstract and the only type in the whole application that derives fromAnimalisDog:

Animal animal = GetSomeAnimal();
animal.Speak();
...
abstract class Animal { ... }
class Dog : Animal { ... } // no other such derived type

or other such validation, it can emit a call toDog.Speak()directly, and the inliner can take its shot.

But for other cases where it can’t prove this with static analysis, the JIT turns to profile-guided optimization (PGO). PGO sounds fancy, but it’s conceptually simple. With “tiered compilation”, when a method is first invoked, it can be compiled “just in time” with few-to-no optimizations (this is referred to as Tier 0). The JIT can include in this compilation additional probes (think “printf debugging”) that let it track a bunch of interesting information about the nature of the code, recording what actually happens when it runs: which branches are taken, what are the concrete types that show up at virtual call sites or cast attempts, and so on. If the method is invoked enough or loops enough times, the runtime can ask the JIT to produce a new optimized version (referred to as Tier 1). That compilation can then factor in all of the learnings gathered as part of that profiling.

The JIT, of course, still needs to generate code that’s always correct. Even if a dynamic profile saysanimalwasDog100% of the time, that doesn’t guarantee it’ll always beDogin the future; it could be that the first 1000 calls passed in aDogbut the 1001st call is going to pass inDolphin. How can the JIT incorporate this learning then? By emitting a run-time check. TheDogpath can get a direct call, which may then be inlinable, and the other path keeps the original virtual call as the fallback. The speed comes from making the common case tiny, while correctness comes from leaving the uncommon case intact.

// Approximately what the JIT generates
if (animal?.GetType() == typeof(Dog))
{
 ((Dog)animal).Speak(); // devirtualized, inlinable
}
else
{
 animal.Speak(); // original virtual call, hopefully rare
}

This “guess and verify” pattern, called “guarded devirtualization” (GDV), accounts for many of the biggest throughput wins in real workloads. It’s applicable not only to virtual dispatch but also to interface dispatch, which also happens to be a bit more expensive than virtual dispatch because a type can implement any number of interfaces and that means the interface slots don’t simply map to fixed vtable positions.

Deabstraction can also make object creation more efficient when it reveals what kind of object is involved. In general, objects in .NET are allocated on the garbage collected heap, tracked by the garbage collector (GC), and collected when no longer reachable. Heap allocation is typically fast, often effectively just bumping a pointer. However, when there’s not enough space available to bump the pointer, it can get much more expensive, including needing to incur a garbage collection. Every allocated object also effectively incurs the amortized cost of all collections, as every allocated object eventually needs to be cleaned up.

“Escape analysis” is the compiler technique that lets us ask whether this object ever “escapes” the current method. If an object reference to a newly allocated object provably doesn’t escape, then the JIT can more efficiently allocate it. It needn’t store it on the GC heap, because nothing could possibly need to reference that object again, so it can instead allocate the object on the stack, making both allocation and cleanup essentially free. Stack allocation is even faster than heap bump-pointer allocation; it’s just decrementing the stack pointer, which is typically already in a register. And more importantly it means zero GC impact, because the stack frame is freed atomically on function return.

The JIT’s been progressively expanding escape analysis over the past several .NET releases, with .NET 9 and 10 seeing significant investments in stack-allocating delegates and closures,Nullable<T>temporaries, and small helper objects. The key theme is that every false positive escape, every time the JIT incorrectly concludes an object may escape when it really doesn’t, represents a heap allocation that could have been avoided, and we want to whittle away at that false positive list. In .NET 11, the JIT trims that list in several ways.

We’ll start with nullable boxing. Consider this benchmark:

// dotnet run -c Release -f net10.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net10.0 net11.0

using BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes;
using BenchmarkDotNet.Running;

BenchmarkSwitcher.FromAssembly(typeof(Benchmarks).Assembly).Run(args);

[MemoryDiagnoser(false), HideColumns("Job", "Error", "StdDev", "Median", "RatioSD")]
public class Benchmarks
{
 private int? _nullableNull;
 private int? _nullableValue = 42;

 [Benchmark]
 public object? BoxNullableNull() => (object?)_nullableNull;

 [Benchmark]
 public object? BoxNullableValue() => (object?)_nullableValue;

 [Benchmark]
 public string? FormatNullableInt() => Format(_nullableValue);

 private static string? Format<T>(T value)
 {
 if (value is IFormattable formattable)
 return formattable.ToString(null, null);

 return null;
 }
}

dotnet/runtime#122167expands nullable boxing inside the JIT, exposing the temporary box to escape analysis; previously, a runtime helper hid it. For anullinput, there’s no allocation on either version, because nothing gets boxed. And on both versions,BoxNullableValuereturns the boxed object, meaning the object escapes, so the 24-byte allocation remains. However, forFormatNullableInt, the JIT in .NET 11 can now see that the temporary 24-byte box doesn’t escape and eliminates that heap allocation entirely.

Escape analysis improved further for enumerators, through a mechanism called Conditional Escape Analysis (CEA). Support for CEA was introduced in .NET 10, but .NET 11 extends the set of patterns that this analysis can safely recognize. The existing escape analysis asks whether a reference created by an allocation can flow somewhere the JIT can no longer track, such as an unknown call. If it can, the object must remain on the heap. That analysis is necessarily conservative and largely flow-insensitive: if an object might be passed to an interface call on any path, it doesn’t try to prove that the path containing that call is mutually exclusive with the path containing the allocation.

Unfortunately, that’s exactly what GDV produces when it optimizes aforeachover anIEnumerable<T>. As noted earlier, GDV turns an interface call into a type check with two branches: a fast branch for the likely collection type and a fallback branch containing the original interface call. Devirtualization and inlining along the fast branch will often reveal an enumerator allocation for the collection type, while later enumerator guards retain fallback calls such asIEnumerator<T>.MoveNext. The existing analysis sees those calls and concludes that the locally allocated enumerator might escape. CEA instead records the relationship between the fast-path allocation and the enumerator local tested by the later guards. If every apparent escape occurs only behind a failed type check, the JIT can clone the region into a hot version where those checks are known to succeed. In that clone, the object can’t reach the fallback calls, so it can be stack-allocated and often promoted into separate scalar locals. The original region remains as the general slow path.

One case .NET 10 didn’t handle, though, was aGetEnumerator()implementation that returns the result of anotherGetEnumerator()call. A collection expression converted toIEnumerable<int>, for example, uses a compiler-generated read-only-array wrapper with exactly this structure: the wrapper’sGetEnumerator()delegates to the underlying array’sGetEnumerator. Withdotnet/runtime#122946, the JIT in .NET 11 handles this “chaining”:

// dotnet run -c Release -f net10.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net10.0 net11.0

using BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes;
using BenchmarkDotNet.Running;

ReadOnlyStatic, whosestatic readonlyfield the JIT can effectively treat as a constant, was already optimized in .NET 10. In .NET 11, the instance-field case also loses its 32-byte enumerator allocation and converges on the same throughput.

dotnet/runtime#121918from@MichalPetrykafixes another way an address could unnecessarily make an object appear to escape. The ILconstrained.prefix lets one genericcallvirtsequence work for both value types and reference types: it can avoid boxing a value type, while for a reference type it dereferences the receiver and performs normal virtual dispatch.ObjectEqualityComparer<T>.Equals, used in the following benchmark byEqualityComparer<T>.Default, contains such a call tovalue.Equals(other). The receiver was represented as an indirect read through the address of a local. Merely taking that address marked the local as exposed, preventing the newly allocatedValuefrom being considered for stack allocation. The receiver is now represented as a direct value load instead, and the 24-byte heap allocation disappears.

While CEA can move a non-escaping object off the GC heap, sometimes the JIT can go further and prove an allocation need not exist at all. Generic code provides a common source of such opportunities through boxing. For example, theArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNullmethod accepts anobject value. That means when you have a method like this:

static void Test<T>(T value)
{
 ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull(value);
 ...
}

whenTis constrained to a non-nullable struct, boxing is incurred, in order to passvalueasobject.ThrowIfNullhere is a nop ifvalueis non-null(since the method is simplyif (value is null) Throw();), and previous releases successfully optimized away that boxing in optimized code. However, in Tier 0, that optimization wasn’t applied, andThrowIfNullwould end up allocating. While this wouldn’t negatively impact steady-state throughput, it would lead to annoying noise in profiling, as well as additional overhead during startup, where such use wasn’t yet promoted out of Tier 0. In .NET 11,dotnet/runtime#129392adds support for this in Tier 0 as well.

On the virtual-dispatch side, multiple PRs contribute to improving generic virtual methods (GVMs).dotnet/runtime#120866from@hez2010stops eagerly spillingldvirtftncall targets into a temporary, and lets generic virtual target resolution move ahead of argument setup when legal.dotnet/runtime#122023from@hez2010then enables the JIT to devirtualize non-shared GVMs, carrying the generic context needed to turn the indirect dispatch into a direct, and potentially inlineable, call. Anddotnet/runtime#128702from@hez2010extends that support to shared GVMs and default interface implementations that require an instantiating stub. These optimizations can increase total code size when the newly direct calls are inlined, but that’s generally the desired trade: more of the actual work becomes visible to the optimizer. Consider the following benchmark:

// dotnet run -c Release -f net10.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net10.0 net11.0

using BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes;
using BenchmarkDotNet.Running;
using System.Runtime.CompilerServices;

BenchmarkSwitcher.FromAssembly(typeof(Benchmarks).Assembly).Run(args);

[MemoryDiagnoser(false), HideColumns("Job", "Error", "StdDev", "Median", "RatioSD")]
public class Benchmarks
{
 [Benchmark]
 public int NonShared() => ((IProcessor)new Processor()).SizeOf(42);

 [Benchmark]
 public int Shared() => ((IProcessor)new Processor()).SizeOf("hello");

 private interface IProcessor
 {
 int SizeOf<T>(T value);
 }

 private sealed class Processor : IProcessor
 {
 public int SizeOf<T>(T value) => Unsafe.SizeOf<T>();
 }
}

Casting a freshly allocatedProcessortoIProcessorincurs an interface generic virtual call in the IL, but the JIT is now able to see the receiver’s exact type, even in the sharedstringcase, such that .NET 11 devirtualizes and inlines both calls. That in turn exposesUnsafe.SizeOf<T>()as a constant and proves that the short-livedProcessordoesn’t need to be allocated at all.

Building on that,dotnet/runtime#123183from@hez2010enables ReadyToRun compilation to resolve and devirtualize more non-shared generic virtual calls that would otherwise remain indirect, anddotnet/runtime#130202from@hez2010extends that support to NativeAOT. NativeAOT represents some generic virtual targets as “fat pointers” (pointers that are more than just an address, typically an address and associated metadata, and that in this case carry both a code address and generic context); by deferring that transformation until after exact-type devirtualization has had a chance to run, the JIT can turn an interface call site with a single known target to a non-shared GVM into a direct call that may then be inlined.

Type information also needs to survive the transformations the JIT performs internally. If the JIT spills a reference expression into a temporary while restructuring a tree, losing the expression’s exact class information can turn a call that was devirtualizable back into an opaque virtual call. That’s what happens here in .NET 10:Valuegets boxed andSetValueis invoked throughIValue.dotnet/runtime#128485from@hez2010preserves the class handle and exactness on the temporary. With that information still available, .NET 11 devirtualizes and inlines the call, eliminating the box and its 24-byte allocation.

Separately,dotnet/runtime#127433relaxes the inliner’s budget heuristics for callees on[Intrinsic]types likeSpanandVector. These types intentionally expose many small, composable methods that serve as gateways to JIT-recognized operations. If a wrapper remains as a call, the caller pays the call overhead and optimizations around it see an opaque boundary. If it inlines, the importer can replace its body with an intrinsic node and optimize that node together with the surrounding indexing, bounds checks, and vector operations. Giving such wrappers more favorable budgeting therefore keeps more of them inlineable and exposes more of the actual operation to the rest of the optimizer.

One of the core abstraction-enabling mechanisms in .NET is delegates: they let us pass around objects representing functions to be invoked, carrying with them associated required state. Deabstraction enables avoiding paying for the overheads associated with delegates in some cases. For the rest, we still want those delegates to be as cheap as possible.dotnet/runtime#99200from@MichalPetrykasimplifies CoreCLR’s delegate
representation, removing one pointer-sized field from every delegate object.
That saves 8 bytes per delegate in a 64-bit CoreCLR process.dotnet/runtime#129304from@MichalPetrykaimproves Native AOT’s
delegate layout separately by reordering its existing four fields so related
values are adjacent. The updated layouts also give equality and hash-code
operations more direct access to the method identity they need.

dotnet/runtime#129410from@MichalPetrykafollows up on the CoreCLR
layout by placing the target object and method pointer next to each other.
Those are commonly consumed together during invocation, and the adjacency
enables paired loads on architectures such as Arm64.

### Runtime Async

For more than a decade,asyncandawaithave let us write asynchronous code that looks remarkably similar to synchronous code: we can put atry/catcharound anawait, use local variables on either side of it, return a value and generally reason about the method in source order. When execution reaches anawaitfor something that isn’t yet complete, however, the method can’t simply leave its current stack frame in place and wait for the operation to finish. The thread needs to be freed up to do other work, while the work after theawait, including whatever local state it will need later, must survive somewhere. In C#, the compiler has traditionally been responsible for transforming the method into a representation that enables that continuation.

I went into the history and mechanics of that transformation inHow async/await really works. The very short version is that the compiler traditionally replaces anasyncmethod with a small entry method and a generated state machine whoseMoveNextmethod contains the transformed user code. Parameters, locals that need to survive an incomplete await, spilled expression values, awaiters, the current state number, and a method builder all become fields on a heap-allocated object. The generatedMoveNextmethod runs the user’s code until an awaiter reports that it isn’t yet complete. It stores enough information to know where and with what values to resume, registersMoveNextas the continuation, and returns. When the operation completes,MoveNextis invoked again, jumps to the right location based on the saved state number (thinkgotoand a label), retrieves the result from a value-producing awaiter, and continues. If every awaiter is already complete,MoveNextcan run all the way through synchronously. When the method completes or throws, the builder publishes the result, cancellation, or exception through the returnedTask,Task<T>,ValueTask, orValueTask<T>(or, in the rare case, a custom task-like type).

For example, consider this tiny method:

static async Task<int> ReadLengthAsync(Stream stream, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
 var buffer = new byte[4096];
 int bytesRead = await stream.ReadAsync(buffer, 0, buffer.Length, cancellationToken);
 return bytesRead;
}

While the code that gets generated for this changes over time and differs between debug and release builds, the lowering by the C# compiler has looked something like this:

[AsyncStateMachine(typeof(<ReadLengthAsync>d__0))]
static Task<int> ReadLengthAsync(Stream stream, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
 <ReadLengthAsync>d__0 stateMachine = default;
 stateMachine.builder = AsyncTaskMethodBuilder<int>.Create();
 stateMachine.state = -1;
 stateMachine.stream = stream;
 stateMachine.cancellationToken = cancellationToken;
 stateMachine.builder.Start(ref stateMachine);
 return stateMachine.builder.Task;
}

struct <ReadLengthAsync>d__0 : IAsyncStateMachine
{
 public int state;
 public AsyncTaskMethodBuilder<int> builder;
 public Stream stream;
 public CancellationToken cancellationToken;

 private TaskAwaiter<int> awaiter;

 public void MoveNext()
 {
 int result;
 try
 {
 TaskAwaiter<int> localAwaiter;

 if (state != 0)
 {
 byte[] buffer = new byte[4096];
 localAwaiter = stream.ReadAsync(buffer, 0, buffer.Length, cancellationToken).GetAwaiter();
 if (!localAwaiter.IsCompleted)
 {
 state = 0;
 awaiter = localAwaiter;
 builder.AwaitUnsafeOnCompleted(ref localAwaiter, ref this);
 return;
 }
 }
 else
 {
 localAwaiter = awaiter;
 awaiter = default;
 state = -1;
 }

 result = localAwaiter.GetResult();
 }
 catch (Exception e)
 {
 state = -2;
 builder.SetException(e);
 return;
 }

 state = -2;
 builder.SetResult(result);
 }
}

That’s quite a lot of generated code for three lines of C#. The compiler has to make decisions before the program runs about the state-machine layout, which values might need to survive, how many awaiter fields are required, and how all the suspension points fit into oneMoveNextdispatch. The runtime and JIT have optimized the resulting pattern heavily over the years, including combining the task, state machine, continuation, andExecutionContextinto a single allocation, but by the time the JIT sees the IL, the transformation has already happened, leaving it with a very complicated system to try to optimize.

.NET 11 introduces a new way to split that responsibility, a reimplementation of theasync/awaitinfrastructure referred to as “runtime async”. Rather than the C# compiler being responsible for the transformation, the JIT is. The C# compiler emits a much smaller suspension-aware IL contract for each eligibleasyncmethod and marks the method asasyncin metadata. The runtime and JIT then do the work that depends on runtime knowledge: creating the externally visibleTaskorValueTask, recognizing direct async calls, deciding which values are actually alive at each suspension point, laying out continuation objects, and generating the control flow that suspends and resumes the method. Effectively, the transformation moves from C# to the runtime, where more information is available to optimize it.

The programming model hasn’t changed. This is still C#async/await;awaitstill obeys the awaiter pattern, exceptions and cancellation still surface through the returned task-like object,ConfigureAwaitstill has its usual meaning, synchronous completion is still synchronous completion, and on and on. An explicit goal for the feature has been 100% behavioral compatibility: whether anasyncmethod is lowered by the language compiler or by the runtime is an implementation detail, and any observable semantic difference is a bug.

In .NET 11, application code opts in with a compiler feature switch:

<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
 <PropertyGroup>
 <TargetFramework>net11.0</TargetFramework>
 <Features>$(Features);runtime-async=on</Features>
 </PropertyGroup>
</Project>

Note that there’s no new C# syntax involved, soLangVersion=previewisn’t required, nor isEnablePreviewFeatures. While this is opt-in at the application layer, most of the in-box shared framework is already built this way for .NET 11. Theasync/awaitperformance goal for .NET 11 is parity with .NET 10, and in general runtime async is already as good as or better than the older implementation in many important paths. It isn’t yet fully optimized, though, and there are known cases where it still produces less efficient code. I’d encourage you to experiment in .NET 11 with opting-in your applications and services; just make sure to measure. My hope is that it’ll be on by default starting in .NET 12.

Moving the transformation from the C# compiler to the runtime has the added benefit of reducing binary size. As noted, the traditional lowering emits an entry method, a generated state-machine type, fields for captured state, and aMoveNextbody, for every async method. Runtime async leaves a much smaller method body for the runtime to transform. The following tiny app contains tenTask<int>-returning async methods, each awaiting the next, and compiles the same source once with compiler lowering and once with runtime async:

For a method such as:

static async Task<int> CallerAsync() => await CalleeAsync();

with runtime async enabled, the C# compiler generates IL like the following:

; MSIL
.method private hidebysig static
 class System.Threading.Tasks.Task`1<int32> CallerAsync() cil managed async
{
 call class System.Threading.Tasks.Task`1<int32> CalleeAsync()
 call int32 System.Runtime.CompilerServices.AsyncHelpers::Await<int32>(
 class System.Threading.Tasks.Task`1<int32>)
 ret
}

There is no generated<CallerAsync>d__0type, noIAsyncStateMachine, noMoveNext, noAsyncTaskMethodBuilder<int>, and noAsyncStateMachineAttribute. Previously,asyncon a C# method evaporated at compile time. Now, the method has a newMethodImplasyncbit, represented in IL assembly syntax by thatasyncmodifier, and the body calls helpers inSystem.Runtime.CompilerServices.AsyncHelpers.

At first glance theretlooks impossible because the declared signature returnsTask<int>while the value on the IL evaluation stack is anint. This clearly isn’t a normal calling convention. The VM can give aTask-returning method two related identities, or MethodDescs, where one has the normal signature the rest of managed code sees,Task<int> CallerAsync(). The other is the AsyncCall variant, which effectively returnsintand has an implicit channel for a continuation. Both refer to the same logical method and metadata token, but they have different calling conventions and different jobs. If regular managed code invokesCallerAsync, the VM-generated outer thunk preserves the public contract and returns aTask<int>. If another runtime async method directly awaits it, the JIT can instead call the AsyncCall variant and receive the result directly when the call completes synchronously, or a continuation when it suspends. In other words, it can hand back theTdirectly and avoid allocating aTask<T>.

That pairing works in both directions. For a method compiled with runtime async, the AsyncCall variant owns the generated (newly compact) IL while the publicTask-returning entry point is an adapter thunk; for a traditionally compiled method, the public method owns its usual IL while the VM can create an AsyncCall adapter around it. That means runtime async code remains able to await existing libraries and code compiled by older compilers, a critical capability for our goal of 100% compat. The largest wins naturally appear as more of an async call chain is compiled with runtime async.

This is where the JIT gets an opportunity that simply didn’t exist when every boundary was already expressed as a task and a generated state machine. SupposeAawaitsB, which awaitsC:

static async Task<int> A(bool yield) => await B(yield);
static async Task<int> B(bool yield) => await C(yield);
static async Task<int> C(bool yield)
{
 if (yield)
 await Task.Yield();

 return 42;
}

Traditionally, each method has its own compiler-generated state machine and its own task-like result.Csuspends and eventually completes its task, which wakesB‘s state machine;Bthen completes its task, which wakesA‘s state machine; andAcompletes the root task observed by the caller. There has been an enormous amount of work done over the years to reduce the costs of those objects and transitions.

With runtime async, the importer recognizes the adjacent pattern of “call a Task-returning method, then await that task.” In the simple case it can call the callee’s AsyncCall variant instead. Whenyieldis false andCcompletes synchronously, theintflows back throughBandAas a plain value, and only the outermost boundary needs to turn it into theTask<int>promised to the original caller. Whenyieldis true andCsuspends, the runtime links continuation state for the chain and eventually resumes it without requiring an intermediateTask<int>at every directly fused edge. TheTaskcontract hasn’t vanished, it just moved to the place where aTaskis actually needed.

Runtime async doesn’t make every asynchronous operation allocation-free, though. Rather, it gives the JIT enough information to avoid materializing some task objects that existed only to carry a result from one async method directly into the next. If a consumer stores the task in a collection, manually hooks up a continuation, or otherwise observes the task as an object, that object is still needed. The optimization is about not paying for boundaries that aren’t observably boundaries.

The impact is already visible with just two layers:

The synchronously completing chain is more than 3x faster and avoids both
intermediate task allocations. Even after a real suspension, the same
two-layer chain takes less than half the time and allocates 80 fewer bytes.

Exception handling amplifies the difference. Again consider an async methodAcalling an async methodBcalling an async methodC. The transformation generated by the C# compiler of each method results in atry/catchblock around the whole body of theMoveNextmethod so that any unhandled exception can be stored into the returnedTask. Let’s say code inCthrows an unhandled exception. That’s then caught by this manufacturedcatchblock and stored into theTaskreturned toB. The awaiter inBthen retrieves that exception from theTaskobject and throws it. It’s then caught byB‘s generated catch and stored into itsTask. And so on. An exception crossing ten such async helpers can therefore be thrown, caught, and stored ten times even though none of the source methods has an explicit handler. That is super expensive. But runtime async doesn’t need to re-enter a pass-through frame with no handler. On the synchronous path the exception unwinds through the fused calls normally, and after a real suspension, one dispatch-loop catch walks past continuation records that have no handler and faults the observable root task once.

The following benchmark measures both a fully synchronous throw and an exception after one realTask.Yieldsuspension. It uses a compiler-recognized per-method escape hatch (RuntimeAsyncMethodGeneration) so that the classic and runtime async methods run in the same process on the same .NET 11 runtime and differ only in how the compiler lowers them. (Note that this attribute is experimental and isn’t a public API exposed from the core libraries; as with other attributes known to the C# compiler, it recognizes them by name and signature.)

Runtime async supportsTask,Task<T>,ValueTask, andValueTask<T>as method return types, but as of today it doesn’t supportasync void, async iterators, or arbitrary custom task-like return types with custom builders; those continue to use the traditional compiler transformation. ForValueTask<T>, the existing reasons to use the type still apply. AValueTask<T>can carry a result directly, wrap aTask<T>, or refer to anIValueTaskSource<T>. That’s made it useful for APIs where synchronous completion is common enough that avoiding aTaskallocation outweighs the larger return value and the more restrictive consumption rules, or where asynchronous completion can have its costs amortized via a reusable backing object. Runtime async then addresses some of the scenarios that would have led developers to useValueTask<T>. Does that mean everyone should stop usingValueTask<T>? No. ChoosingTaskversusValueTaskremains an API design decision based on completion patterns, allocation sensitivity, call frequency, and how consumers need to use the result. Write the return type that makes sense for the API, then let the compiler, VM, and JIT optimize it as best they can.

Workloads with many layers of small async methods can benefit the most from runtime
async, because those layers are exactly where intermediate tasks and state
machines often accumulate. Shared framework code, for example, is full of this
pattern: a public method validates arguments and awaits a private helper, which
awaits a transport helper, which awaits an operating-system operation.
Application services similarly compose authentication, retry, logging,
serialization, and I/O helpers. Runtime async can make the source-level
decomposition cheaper without asking the developer to flatten the code into
one giant method in order to avoid “implementation detail” costs.

The work required to reach this point has been extensive. A GitHub search of theruntime async tracking labelon September 14, 2026 returned 235 pull requests, far too many for me to enumerate one by one. So I won’t try; you can peruse that label in your spare time. The work is also not only about direct performance improvements but also about
improvements to diagnostics and performance tooling that help you to make better
use of async in your own code. When an async method
suspends, its physical thread stack unwinds. That method’s continuation might later run
on a different thread whose physical stack begins in the thread pool, with the
methods that led to the originalawaitnowhere to be found. A sampling
CPU profiler can see where the processor is spending time, but without additional
information, it can’t reliably connect those traces back through the logical async
call chain, making it hard to answer questions about what async call paths were actually costing.
Profiling tools like the async profiler in Visual Studio have traditionally reconstructed those chains from
events emitted byTask‘s infrastructure, but async-heavy applications can generate enormous volumes of
those very chatty events. The resulting overhead easily perturbs the workload being measured, making
it all but unusable in production.dotnet/runtime#127238added a
new lightweight async-profiler event stream for .NET 11 and runtime async. Rather than sending every small
transition through the eventing system as its own full event, the runtime
writes compact records into per-thread buffers, delta-encoding timestamps and
instruction pointers and flushing the data in batches. It also puts a small
identifiable wrapper frame into the physical stack when invoking a
continuation. A profiler can use that frame as an anchor, joining ordinary CPU
samples to the logical async call stack represented by the event stream. In some measurements,
this new approach added less than 1% overhead and shrank the traced data by an order of magnitude.dotnet/runtime#129043and a few follow-up PRs extended
the same approach to the compiler-generated state machines used by existing
async code. Thus this
isn’t useful only to applications that opt into runtime async; tooling gets one
consistent representation across both implementations.

What should you as a developer do differently with runtime async in the picture? Mostly nothing. Keep writing asynchronous code the way you want it to read, and break a large operation into helpers when that makes the code clearer. UseTaskby default and chooseValueTaskwhere its API and usage tradeoffs genuinely fit. And don’t contort source code to remove a cleanawaitjust because today’s implementation might allocate an intermediateTask. The lowering strategy should “just work” as an implementation detail, preserve behavior, and make existing source get better as the runtime improves.

### Bounds Checks

C# is a memory-safe language. Accesses to arrays, strings, and spans are guaranteed by the runtime to be in-bounds; if you try to accesssomeArray[i],someString[i], orsomeSpan[i]with an index less than 0 or greater than or equal to the length of the array/string/span, you’ll get an exception, not silently corrupted memory or a process crash. The runtime guarantees that all permitted accesses are within bounds, and that means it needs to be able to prove the access is in bounds. The main method the JIT has for achieving that is by injecting code that performs a bounds check, as if instead of:

int[] array = ...;
int value = array[i];

you’d written:

int[] array = ...;
if ((uint)i >= array.Length) throw new IndexOutOfRangeException();
int value = array[i];

At the assembly level, a bounds check looks something like:

; x64
cmp ecx, dword ptr [rax+8] ; compare index with array length
jae THROW ; unsigned index >= length
mov edx, dword ptr [rax+rcx*4+16] ; load the element

The JIT could just inject such code on every access and call it a day, but such code adds overhead, so the JIT works to elide those checks and that overhead wherever it can prove the index is valid. Proving an index is valid means the JIT needs to be able to see from other evidence that it couldn’t possibly be out of bounds.

The quintessential example of that is aforloop over the full contents of an array or span:

for (int i = 0; i < array.Length; i++)
{
 Use(array[i]);
}

The JIT recognizes from this idiom that, within the loop body,iis guaranteed to be in the range[0, array.Length), and avoids emitting the bounds check for thearray[i]access. The JIT has long handled this particular case. Other cases, not so much. Bounds-check elimination has improved in virtually every .NET release; more recent releases added range propagation for derived expressions (.NET 7and.NET 8saw significant improvements here), SSA-based reasoning (.NET 9), and better handling ofSpan<T>, whose length sits in a field rather than an object header, complicating tracking. Each year, the developers contributing to the JIT find new patterns that were being missed, that show up in the wild, and that are fixable. .NET 11 improves several such patterns.

Range analysis in the JIT tracks intervals for each variable, an upper bound and a lower bound. For example, taking the true branch ofx < 5gives the range forxin that branch an upper bound of 4 while taking the true branch ofx > 2makes the lower bound 3. What aboutx != 5? On the true edge, we knowxisn’t 5, and if the current range forxis[5, 10], then we know the range must actually be[6, 10]… the lower bound can be tightened because the only value at the lower end is excluded. Similarly, if the range is[0, 5], anx != 5assertion tells us the range is actually the narrower[0, 4]. Or, at least, that’s what you’d hope it would do. The JIT had this relevant comment:

// We have a != assertion, but it doesn't tell us much about the interval. So just skip it.
continue;

In .NET 11,dotnet/runtime#121273replaces that logic with productive reasoning. It checks whether the excluded constant is at either edge of the currently tracked range, adding in the new insights if so. C# list patterns, introduced in C# 11, generate just such comparison sequences. For example, the patternname is [] or [':'] or [':', not ':', ..]lowers to something like this:

if (name != null)
{
 int num = name.Length;

 if (num == 0) return true;

 if (num == 1)
 {
 if (name[0] == ':') return true;
 }
 else if (name[0] == ':' && name[1] != ':')
 {
 return true;
 }

 return false;
}

Range analysis then proceeds with something like this:

1. We know thatArray.Lengthis never negative, so it has a range of[0, Array.MaxLength].
2. On the false edge ofnum == 0, we know thatnum != 0, so the range is narrowed now to[1, Array.MaxLength].
3. Similarly, on the false edge ofnum == 1, we know thatnum != 1, so the range is narrowed now to[2, Array.MaxLength].
4. We then accessname[0]andname[1], both of which are guaranteed in bounds based on the lower bound of 2 that was established.

Without the!= constanttightening, that narrowing wouldn’t happen, and the bounds checks in step 4 couldn’t be elided. Thankfully, they now can be in .NET 11. Consider this example:

// dotnet run -c Release -f net10.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net10.0 net11.0

In .NET 10, we can see the call toCORINFO_HELP_RNGCHKFAILat the bottom of the method. That’s the tell-tale sign there was at least one bounds check in the method. With .NET 11, that sign is removed.

“Assertion” machinery in the JIT propagates learned facts (like the aforementioned range information) between “basic blocks” (a sequence of instructions with one entry point, one exit point, and no branches into or out of the middle of it), so information established in block A flows to block B if A “dominates” B (meaning the only way to get to B is through A). But what about facts established earlier within the same block? That’s the gap thatdotnet/runtime#121527addresses. Consider this code:

// dotnet run -c Release -f net10.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net10.0 net11.0

using BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes;

 i++; // 2: same block
 if (i < arr.Length) arr[i] = 0; // 3: proven safe from 1's assertion
 }
}

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are all in the same basic block, up to the conditional; after statement 1 executes, if we reach statement 2, the bounds check on statement 1 passed, we knowi >= 0andi < arr.Length, and after statement 2,ibecomesi + 1. After theifguardi < arr.Lengthwe know the incrementediis still within bounds. But when the range check pass in the .NET 10 JIT examined statement 3’s bounds check, it saw the assertions propagated from predecessor blocks. Since the assertion from statement 1 is generated within the current block, the range check couldn’t see it. The PR fixed it to walk the current block’s tree in execution order, accumulating assertions as it went. When we reach statement 3’s bounds check, we’ve already walked past statement 1 and picked up itsi >= 0 && i < arr.Lengthassertion.

There are almost an infinite number of things the JIT could look for and special-case. But every special case requires code, maintenance, and, most importantly, compilation time. A “just-in-time” compiler typically runs while the application is running, so the JIT itself must be optimized and spend its limited budget only where there’s a likely payoff. That pushes the developers building it toward patterns that occur in real workloads. One such pattern, often seen in libraries like format decoders, builds a table
index with bitwise operations on a byte, for example((b & 0x03) << 4) | ((b & 0xf0) >> 4). Each masked piece has a tiny upper
bound, so the OR of those pieces is always in[0..63], safely in range for
e.g. a Base64 alphabet table. Untildotnet/runtime#122263, the JIT
often failed to prove that combined bound and left a bounds check on the
index. Existing range-check code understood the upper bounds produced by
bitwise AND and shifts, but not OR; the change lets the JIT combine the known
bounds of both OR operands and remove the remaining array check.

As another example,dotnet/runtime#125056improves the handling of guards like(uint)i < span.Lengththat are pervasive in performance-sensitive code. Consider this benchmark:

// dotnet run -c Release -f net10.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net10.0 net11.0

using BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes;
using BenchmarkDotNet.Running;
using System.Runtime.CompilerServices;

 {
 if (i != 0)
 return span[i - 1] + span[i];

 return span[i];
 }

 return 0;
 }
}

Because the comparison is unsigned,(uint)iwould be a large positive number ifiwere negative, making it impossible for(uint)i < (uint)span.Lengthto be true (since a span’s length is never negative,(uint)span.Lengthis at mostint.MaxValue). Inside the true branch,iis therefore in[0, span.Length - 1]. Previously, the JIT wasn’t always recording the lower boundi >= 0when it processed the(uint)i < span.Lengthassertion, and that could leave bounds checks on expressions likei - 1in place. The fix adds the[0, int.MaxValue - 1]lower bound deduction for the index variable upon entering the true arm of a(uint)i < span.Lengthcheck. Combined with the existing range tracking for the upper bound, this gives the JIT a complete picture ofi‘s range inside the guarded block.

Bounds check elision is generally based on forms of range analysis, where the JIT needs to prove that a given index is guaranteed to be within the range of the data structure. But the same range analysis-based facts can prove that other checks are unnecessary. For example, once the JIT knows that an integer is in[0..100], it can prove both that converting it tobytecan’t lose data and that multiplying it by 10 can’t overflow.dotnet/runtime#124147enables the JIT to use such facts to avoid unnecessary branches as part ofcheckedoperations. When range analysis proves that the operands are in ranges whose result can’t overflow, makingcheckeda nop, the backend can now emit plain add/multiply/subtract instructions, without the jump to failure, as in the following example:

// dotnet run -c Release -f net10.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net10.0 net11.0

That makes the change broadly applicable: any time you writecheckedarithmetic on quantities that are inherently bounded, such as collection counts, lengths, or indices constrained by prior comparisons, the JIT now has a chance to prove at compile time that the overflow can’t happen and thus eliminate the run-time check entirely. Building on that range-check work,dotnet/runtime#124184teaches the JIT to eliminate “narrowing casts” under the same kinds of guards:

Such use ofcheckedis common in serialization and protocol code where you validate a value’s range prior to truncating it. In this benchmark I’ve usedcheckedexplicitly, but the more common form is with the whole project compiled with<CheckForOverflowUnderflow>true</CheckForOverflowUnderflow>in the .csproj, such that thischeckedbecomes implicit. After the change, the range analysis sees thatvalueis in the range[0, 100], knowsbytefits values up to 255, and elides the check.

dotnet/runtime#128620further teaches range analysis the possible results of leading-zero count, trailing-zero count, and population count instructions. Those results are often used to index small lookup tables… knowing their bounds lets the JIT remove the bounds check.

The lookup improves because the JIT now knowsLeadingZeroCount(uint)is between 0 and 32 and can remove the bounds check.

The JIT is also able to conditionally apply range check-based elision via “cloning”. Cloning is a mechanism where the JIT takes one piece of code and duplicates it. One of the copies it leaves as it was originally, and the other copy it special cases. So, for example, if you had code like:

int value = array[i];

the JIT could theoretically clone that in order to avoid the implicit bounds check, e.g.

int value;
if ((uint)i < array.Length)
{
 // no bounds check emitted by JIT, e.g.
 value = Unsafe.Add(ref MemoryMarshal.GetArrayDataReference(array), i);
}
else
{
 // bounds check emitted
 value = array[i];
}

That particular code looks silly, as we’re just trading an implicit bounds check for an explicit one. It becomes less silly when the JIT is able to elide multiple bounds checks with a single branch, e.g.

int sum;
if (4 < array.Length)
{
 // zero bounds checks
 ref int startRef = ref MemoryMarshal.GetArrayDataReference(array);
 sum =
 startRef +
 Unsafe.Add(ref startRef, 1) +
 Unsafe.Add(ref startRef, 2) +
 Unsafe.Add(ref startRef, 3);
}
else
{
 // potentially four bounds checks
 sum =
 array[0] +
 array[1] +
 array[2] +
 array[3];
}

Such optimizations are already handled in the JIT, via itsoptRangeCheckCloningphase. It groups bounds checks from a basic block, emits one guard for the largest required range, and duplicates the affected code into a fast path where the individual checks can be removed and a fallback path where they remain. However, one long-standing limitation of range-check cloning is that it refused to process the last statement of any “terminator” block, a block that ends with a jump or return instruction. For a method like:

static int ArrayAccess(int[] abcd) => abcd[0] + abcd[1] + abcd[2] + abcd[3];

all four array accesses live in the return statement, the last statement of a return block, so nothing got cloned and the hot path retained four separate bounds checks. In .NET 11,dotnet/runtime#124705removes that restriction, making the return statement eligible for range-check cloning and allowing a single fast-path guard to cover all four accesses.

But even without range-check cloning, there’s really no reason such accesses should require four bounds checks: the JIT should be able to see that the array or span needs to have a length of at least 4 and guard all accesses by that single check. If there were intervening operations that had side effects, the JIT would need to maintain order of operations, at least enough to maintain the observable behavior of those effects, but that’s not the case here. Withdotnet/runtime#127439in .NET 11, the JIT will now coalesce those checks within a basic block, strengthening the first check to the largest constant index and removing the rest.

// dotnet run -c Release -f net10.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net10.0 net11.0

In previous releases, you’d sometimes see a proactive developer doing a similar optimization manually, e.g. reordering the accesses in an example like that to put the largest read first. That’s no longer necessary.

Another bounds checking improvement comes indotnet/runtime#127488, which actually targets explicitly-implemented bounds checks (rather than the implicit ones we’ve been discussing) and targets code that reads a fixed-size value from the end of a span, such asBinaryPrimitives.ReadInt32BigEndian(span.Slice(span.Length - 4))behind aspan.Length >= 4guard, e.g.

if (span.Length >= 4)
{
 // Parse an int from the end of the span
 ... = ReadInt32BigEndian(span.Slice(span.Length - 4));
 ...
}

There shouldn’t be any additional bounds checking required here. However,Span.Slicebegins with:

if ((uint)start > (uint)_length)
 ThrowHelper.ThrowArgumentOutOfRangeException();

andReadInt32BigEndianbegins with:

if (sizeof(T) > source.Length)
 ThrowHelper.ThrowArgumentOutOfRangeException();

so even though ourspan.Length >= 4check should have been sufficient, we’re still ending up with two additional checks. To address that, the JIT needed two things.

First, it needed to be able to identify thatx - (x + a)is the same as-a. Without this identity,length - (length - 4)is just an opaque subtraction of two expressions with no obvious constant result. With the identity, the JIT can recognize the inner expression(length - 4)aslength + (-4), applyx - (x + a) == -awithx == lengthanda == -4, and end up with-(-4) == 4. NowReadInt32BigEndian‘s check against 4 becomes4 >= 4, which the JIT can trivially see is true.

Second,Slice(start)must establish thatstartis between zero and the span’s length. Whenstartislength - 4, the existinglength >= 4guard proves the result is non-negative, while subtracting a positive constant means the result can’t exceedlength. The improved range analysis connects that guard to the subtraction and removesSlice‘s check.

Both fixes together mean the above example now elides both extra bounds
checks. That’s useful in particular for libraries like parsers, network
protocol implementations, and cryptographic code, all of which frequently on
hot paths do things like “read the last N bytes of a buffer.”

 {
 if (span.Length >= sizeof(int))
 {
 return BinaryPrimitives.ReadInt32BigEndian(span.Slice(span.Length - sizeof(int)));
 }

 return -1;
 }
}

In .NET 10, the helper is 73 bytes and includes both additional checks and
their throw paths:

; x64
cmp ecx,4
jl RETURN_MINUS_ONE
lea edx,[rcx-4]
cmp edx,ecx
ja THROW_SLICE
mov r8d,edx
add rax,r8
sub ecx,edx
cmp ecx,4
jl THROW_READ
movbe eax,[rax]

In .NET 11, the helper is 28 bytes, and only the original length guard remains:

; x64
cmp ecx,4
jl RETURN_MINUS_ONE
add ecx,-4
add rax,rcx
movbe eax,[rax]

dotnet/runtime#122040anddotnet/runtime#127117similarly help to remove bounds checks involvingspan.Slice. Vectorized loops often work through a span a chunk at a time, slicing off the elements they’ve already processed. The JIT hasn’t always been able to keep track of how those progressively smaller slices relate to the original span, so it could end up checking the same limits again on each iteration. These changes improve that tracking, enabling more of those repeated checks to be removed.

In .NET 10, the loop condition proves that at least one vector remains, but
the construction of the vector from the current span performs the same check
again. .NET 11 retains the length relationship, so
the loop body begins directly with the vector addition:

+add ecx, 0FFFFFFFC
+cmp ecx, 4
 jge LOOP

We saw earlier how range-check cloning enables duplicating a sequence of instructions in order to eliminate bounds checks. “Loop cloning” extends that to a whole loop. Consider a loop that processes the firstcountelements of an array:

for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
 sum += values[i];

The testi < countdoesn’t by itself prove thati < values.Length, so by default the compilation would need a bounds check in the body, which would mean a bounds check for everyvalues[i]access. Loop cloning gives the JIT another option. Instead of generating the equivalent of:

for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
 sum += values[i]; // bounds check!

it can generate the equivalent of:

if ((uint)count <= (uint)values.Length)
{
 // no bounds checks
 ref int startRef = ref MemoryMarshal.GetArrayDataReference(values);
 for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
 {
 sum += Unsafe.Add(ref startRef, i);
 }
}
else
{
 // bounds check per iteration
 for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
 {
 sum += values[i];
 }
}

For the common case where the iteration is in bounds, execution proceeds through a cloned loop with no per-iteration bounds checks, whereas the original checked loop remains as the fallback that preserves exceptional behavior for invalid inputs. The normal path pays for one guard and avoids a check on every iteration, but that comes at the expense of duplicating code. The JIT therefore needs to apply the optimization selectively.

The JIT has long employed loop cloning, but it didn’t always kick in even in cases it seemed applicable. The previous example showed loop cloning with<in the iteration condition. For whatever reason, however, some developers used!=, and loop cloning didn’t apply (I’m guessing they used!=because they thought it was more efficient, and they actually end up deoptimizing). Thanks todotnet/runtime#129268, in .NET 11!=is now also handled, as long as specific conditions are met, such as the stride being exactly 1 or -1, e.g.i++qualifies, whilei += 2doesn’t.dotnet/runtime#129303also improves loops that terminate withi != bound, giving the JIT a tighter understanding of the valuesican take and allowing it to remove some bounds checks even when it can’t clone the whole loop.

Lookahead in arrays and spans is another recurring pattern, especially in parsers.dotnet/runtime#124242anddotnet/runtime#125235recognize conditions such as(uint)(i + 2) < (uint)span.Lengthand use that relation to remove the follow-on checks forspan[i + 1]andspan[i + 2]. Consider this benchmark:

Several smaller changes broaden the range of code from which the JIT can remove bounds checks:

* dotnet/runtime#121640helps in a situation where once an access using a chosen index has been checked, a later access to the same array at that index need not be checked again.
* dotnet/runtime#121683enables the JIT to trace an array’s length through calculations performed earlier in the method, exposing more redundant checks, including some involving index-from-end expressions.
* dotnet/runtime#124387anddotnet/runtime#130326teach the optimizer to rely on a span’s length always being non-negative.
* dotnet/runtime#124571improves sequences of index-from-end accesses: once an access likearr[^4]establishes that the array has at least four elements, the JIT reuses that information for nearby accesses such asarr[^3].
* dotnet/runtime#129101improves how the JIT combines and carries forward the possible ranges of arithmetic expressions, including expressions involving bitwise OR and unsigned division. Those tighter ranges can show that more values are non-negative or within bounds.

Bounds-check elimination is only one payoff from understanding a loop’s structure. The JIT analyzes induction variables (values like loop counters that change predictably each iteration) and puts loops into standard forms so that later optimizations can reason about them. .NET 11 broadens the range of loops for which that works:

* dotnet/runtime#122184recognizes another representation of a 32-to-64-bit zero extension. That lets pointer loops using expressions such asdata[(uint)i]replace the repeated index extension and address calculation with a pointer increment.
* dotnet/runtime#119537follows simple control-flow predecessors when finding an induction variable’s initialization and zero-trip test, whiledotnet/runtime#128303gives loops with multiple backedges a single canonical latch block.
* dotnet/runtime#128532makes loop cloning tolerate more statements around the update and test.
* dotnet/runtime#129309extends cloning to more span loops with non-unit strides and offset limits.
* dotnet/runtime#129349handles large strides in array loops with an explicit safety guard rather than rejecting them outright.
* dotnet/runtime#129472allows loop inversion to spend more of its budget on likely cloning candidates.
* dotnet/runtime#130205removes comparisons that are redundant given the induction variable’s known range.
* dotnet/runtime#131362corrects profile weights after inversion changes a loop’s exit.

Much of this work wasn’t motivated by contrived benchmarks containing nothing
but array indexing as I’m prone to use in these posts. Rather, many of the improvements
stemmed from an ongoing audit of unsafe code throughout the
.NET libraries, part of a broadereffort to improve memory safety in .NET. .NET and C# are memory safe, but as with other memory safe languages like Rust,
it provides escape hatches that enable turning off the guardrails provided by the compiler and runtime.
This effort is about reducing where and when developers feel compelled to use those escape hatches, since every
occurrence is an opportunity for increased risk. Unsafe code was often introduced years earlier to manually avoid bounds
checks, typically by walking a buffer with pointers, byrefs, orUnsafe.Add.
Sometimes the audit found that the unsafe code was no longer needed and could
simply be removed. Sometimes a “safe” rewrite (meaning not usingunsafeand friends) was already just as fast or even faster.
And sometimes the rewrite exposed an optimization the JIT was missing, in which
case the answer was to improve the JIT and then rewrite the library code to use
normal, bounds-checked C#. Several of the optimizations discussed in this
section are the result of exactly that feedback loop.dotnet/runtime#127429is a
particularly nice example. The vectorized implementation ofEnumerable.SumusedMemoryMarshal.GetReference,Vector.LoadUnsafe, andUnsafe.Addto walk
its input without bounds checks. With the span-slicing improvements described
earlier, it could instead useVector.Create(span),span.Slice(...), and aforeachfor the tail. That’s easier to reason about, removes the unchecked
indexing, and ended up being faster.dotnet/runtime#114757similarly
replaced an unsafe pointer-based header-name accessor with a genericReadOnlySpan<T>implementation without loss of performance.
Similarly,dotnet/runtime#121270removed
more unsafe code fromUriparsing and actually improved performance of the cited code measurably.

There’s a useful “go do” here for libraries outside of dotnet/runtime, as well.
Unsafe code written to work around the JIT is a snapshot of what the JIT could
do at the time that code was written. If you own code that has hand-written pointer orUnsafe-based loops whose purpose is to avoid bounds checks, it’s worth
rewriting them with safe, bounds-checked C# and measuring again on .NET 11.
Chances are, you’ll find the gap at this point is either non-existent or small
enough that it’s not worth the increased maintenance and risk for managing the safety yourself.
And if the revised version is still slower, that’s a great opportunity for you to share a repro
in the dotnet/runtime repo, hopefully serving as inspiration for one of the first performance improvements
to go into the JIT for .NET 12.unsafecode is still necessary for scenarios like interop,
but performance alone shouldn’t be a permanent reason to eschew all the valuable guardrails .NET provides.

TheC# 15 memory-safety previewpushes in the same direction and is part and parcel of this effort. Historically, C# has largely equated pointers
with unsafe code: simply declaring or manipulating a pointer generally required
anunsafecontext, even if the code never accessed the memory to which it
points. In the preview, pointer plumbing such as declaring a pointer, taking an
address with&, usingfixed, convertingstackallocto a pointer, and
applyingsizeofto an unmanaged type no longer requires anunsafecontext.
Operations that actually access the pointed-to memory, including*p,p->member, andp[i], still do. C# 15 also adds anunsafe(expression)form,
analogous tochecked(expression), so an unsafe context can cover one precise
expression rather than a larger statement block. Those changes are the first preview slice of a larger, multi-releaseunsafe evolution.
The end goal is to make unsafe regions smaller, make their assumptions visible through the call graph,
and make them easier for reviewers and tools to find. Pairing that with a JIT
that makes idiomatic safe code fast removes a lot of the historical pressure to
use unsafe code in the first place.

### Assertion Propagation

As discussed earlier, the JIT continually learns facts while compiling a method: a value equals a constant, a reference isn’t null, an integer falls within a particular range, and so on. “Assertion propagation” carries those facts forward so they can simplify later code. “Value numbering” complements it by letting the JIT recognize when two expressions compute the same value, even if they appear in different places or use different variables. Together, these mechanisms enable optimizations such as removing redundant null and bounds checks, folding conditions to constants, and reusing repeated computations. .NET 11 improves assertion propagation primarily by fixing places where useful facts were either never recorded or weren’t recognized later.

For example, reading an array’s length normally carries an implicit null-check: if the array reference isnull, the read must throw. Once global assertion propagation already knows the reference is non-null, however, we should be able to avoid the implicit null check. In .NET 11,dotnet/runtime#124291takes care of that forArray.Length:

// dotnet run -c Release -f net10.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net10.0 net11.0

using BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes;
using BenchmarkDotNet.Running;
using System.Runtime.CompilerServices;

BenchmarkSwitcher.FromAssembly(typeof(Benchmarks).Assembly).Run(args);

public class Benchmarks
{
 private readonly int[] _values = new int[1024];

 [Benchmark]
 public void DeadLength() => Test(_values);

 [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]
 private static void Test(int[]? values)
 {
 if (values is not null)
 _ = values.Length;
 }
}

The .NET 10 code still tests the reference and reads the length. In .NET 11, the guard proves the read can’t throw, and since its result isn’t used, the access disappears:

dotnet/runtime#119474improves
the starting point for integer range analysis. The JIT now uses facts inherent
in a value itself, e.g. a constant has one exact value, while a value converted
tobyte, for example, must be between 0 and 255. That can eliminate bounds
checks and conditions even when no precedingifexplicitly established the
range.dotnet/runtime#124415further refines this handling of casts, combining what is known about both the
source value and the destination type to derive the tightest useful range.

Those improvements derive ranges from facts inherent in a value, but ranges
can also come from control flow. Afterif ((uint)x < 10), for example, the
JIT knows thatxis between 0 and 9 on the true path, which may be enough to
remove a later comparison or array bounds check.dotnet/runtime#123624derives tighter ranges from assertions and casts, including proving that some
comparisons are always true or false.dotnet/runtime#129390preserves range information more accurately when control-flow paths merge.

Other changes make better use of the ranges once known.dotnet/runtime#129354traces values back through their definitions to fold more span- and slice-related comparisons, anddotnet/runtime#126917uses narrowed ranges to remove more relational branches.

dotnet/runtime#124711teaches the JIT to learn implicit facts from operations that have already completed successfully. For example:

* Creating an array proves its requested length wasn’t negative.
* A reference-array store may need a runtime covariance check, because a value typed asobject[]can actually refer to astring[]; the helper that performs that type check also validates the index, so if it returns successfully, the index was in range.
* Integer division or modulo proves the divisor wasn’t zero.

And so on. Those facts can then remove redundant checks and conditions later in the method.

 {

 objArr[3] = _value;
 return objArr[2];
 }
}

A successful store to element 3 proves that particular array has at least four elements; since an array’s length can’t change, the subsequent read of element 2 doesn’t need another bounds check.

dotnet/runtime#128522simplifies how the global assertion pass identifies values, making it less likely to miss a fact learned earlier. One practical impact of this is better propagation of a staticstring‘s known length, which can turn a general string comparison into a fixed-size vectorized comparison.

dotnet/runtime#127810improves null-check elimination where control flow merges. With??=, which is a very common operator used for lazy initialization, the resulting value is non-null whether it came from the existing field or from the newly allocated object. The JIT now combines the facts from both paths and recognizes that the subsequent call doesn’t need another null check.

// dotnet run -c Release -f net10.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net10.0 net11.0

using BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes;

 public int Invoke(int n) => (_inner ??= new()).Increment(n);

 private sealed class Inner
 {
 [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]
 public int Increment(int n) => n + 1;
 }
}

The generated code consequently loses the null check on the merged value:

 call qword ptr [...] ; Inner.Increment(Int32)

dotnet/runtime#128701removes similarly redundant null checks from copies of structs that contain object references. Such copies use a runtime helper so the garbage collector is correctly notified about the reference writes, but lowering had been adding probes for both source and destination without preserving whether either address could actually fault. It now emits only the probes that are needed.

// dotnet run -c Release -f net10.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net10.0 net11.0

using BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes;
using BenchmarkDotNet.Running;

 public void BulkStructCopy() => _dst = _src;

 private struct FourRefs
 {
 public object? A;

 public object? C;
 public object? D;
 }
}

Both_srcand_dstare fields of the same object, so after probing the source address has established that the object isn’t null, probing the destination address can’t provide any additional information. .NET 11 removes that second probe:

; Arm64
 G_M000_IG02:

 ldrsb wzr, [x1]
 add x0, x0, #40

+; Total bytes of code 52

Additionally,dotnet/runtime#125215lets the JIT retain and efficiently find more assertions in larger methods, increasing the opportunities for the same kinds of simplification. Anddotnet/runtime#129312removes unnecessary temporary variables when the same simple field address is used multiple times, enabling more efficient loads and stores.

### Simplification

Assertion propagation is largely about proving things to help the generated code. Once the JIT knows enough about an operation’s inputs, it can often replace the operation with something simpler and cheaper.

“Constant folding” is a fancy way of saying the compiler does work once so it doesn’t need to be repeated at run time. If the compiler has everything it needs to compute an answer when building, it can bake that answer in to the generated code and avoid needing the code to re-compute it. That answer can then be further used by other computations at build time, potentially folding further. The C# compiler handles constant folding expressions composed entirely of language constants, while the JIT compiler can go further after inlining and after learning things about values and control flow. The JIT already does a ton of folding, and as with every release, it goes further in .NET 11.

One straightforward example is the offset of a field within a struct.dotnet/runtime#122297recognizes more cases where two addresses refer to the same struct and replaces their difference with the known field offset. Here, the secondintfield begins four bytes into the struct:

// dotnet run -c Release -f net10.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net10.0 net11.0

using BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes;
using BenchmarkDotNet.Running;
using System.Runtime.CompilerServices;

BenchmarkSwitcher.FromAssembly(typeof(Benchmarks).Assembly).Run(args);

[DisassemblyDiagnoser, HideColumns("Job", "Error", "StdDev", "Median", "RatioSD")]
public unsafe class Benchmarks
{
 private struct MyStruct
 {
 public int A;
 public int Field;
 }

 [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.AggressiveInlining)]
 private static nint OffsetOfFieldInline()
 {
 MyStruct dummy;
 return (nint)((byte*)&dummy.Field - (byte*)&dummy);
 }

 [Benchmark]
 [Arguments(1_000)]
 public nint OffsetOfFieldLoop(int n)
 {
 nint sum = 0;
 for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
 sum += OffsetOfFieldInline();

 return sum;
 }

}

Without the fold, the loop repeatedly computes the field offset. With the fold, each iteration simply adds the constant4.

dotnet/runtime#121985from@hez2010enables the JIT to evaluateSequenceEqualat compile time when both inputs are known.SequenceEqualnormally walks two sequences element by element, stopping at the first mismatch. But if inlining exposes both sequences as constants, there’s nothing useful left to do at run time: the JIT can compare them while compiling and replace the whole operation with a constanttrueorfalse. This intrinsic underpins APIs includingMemoryExtensions.SequenceEqual,ReadOnlySpan<T>.SequenceEqual, andstring.Equals.

Because these properties aren’tconst, the C# compiler can’t evaluate the comparisons. The JIT, however, can see the string literals after inlining. It now folds comparisons of the same input whose contents are available at the time of compilation.CompareDistincttherefore becomes a constantfalse.

Folding an operation is only the first step, though. The result can then simplify later code, even when it’s a vector.dotnet/runtime#127124extends assertion propagation to 128-bit integer vector constants. If a branch establishes that a vector is zero, uses of that vector within the branch can now be replaced with zero and simplified just like scalar values.

Two backend cleanups take advantage of simpler expressions.dotnet/runtime#124332from@jonathandavies-armremoves an unnecessary negation when Arm64 code compares a negated value with zero. Anddotnet/runtime#124642from@yykkibbblets short-circuit Boolean returns fold even when inlining has left unused writes in the same block; those stores previously obscured the simple Boolean expression from the optimizer.

Branches offer another opportunity for simplification. Modern processors work on several instructions at different stages at the same time. When a processor encounters a conditional branch, it predicts which path will be taken so that it can continue fetching and executing instructions speculatively. A correct prediction hides much of the branch’s cost. A misprediction throws away that speculative work, redirects instruction fetch to the correct path, and refills the processor’s execution pipeline. That can make the predictability of a branch as important as the work in either branch. The JIT can sometimes avoid that variability, particularly inside small hot loops, by replacing a branch with a conditional move instruction or by recognizing that several branches describe one simpler condition. This isn’t always profitable: branchless code may evaluate work that a predictable branch would skip, making the branching code less expensive in the majority case. But it can be valuable for small, data-dependent choices.

dotnet/runtime#124567recognizes zero-based equality chains, e.g.value == 0 || value == 1 || value == 2. Such chains can be replaced with an
unsigned range check, e.g.(uint)value <= 2, producing a branchless result.
The unsigned comparison also handles negative inputs: when interpreted as
unsigned, any negativeintis larger than the upper bound.

The widening cast disappears, reducing the Arm64 method from 80 bytes to 76 bytes.

The examples thus far simplify individual comparisons.dotnet/runtime#127181also combines multiple comparisons in the same expression. For example,(x >= c) && (x <= c)can only be true whenx == c; corresponding OR forms can be simplified similarly.

Once the JIT can reason about one comparison in terms of another, it can apply the same idea across branches.dotnet/runtime#126587removes an earlier test when a later, stronger test subsumes it. For example,if (x > 0) if (x > 1)needs only thex > 1test, as reaching the nested body withx > 1necessarily also meansx > 0.

Rather than simply removing a test, the JIT can sometimes use the outcome of an earlier branch to choose the destination of a later one. This is known as “jump threading”: the JIT threads a control-flow path through the intervening jumps directly to its eventual destination. For example, consider:

int value = condition ? 1 : 2;
if (value == 1)
{
 One();
}
else
{
 Two();
}

The path whereconditionis true can go directly toOne, while the false path can go directly toTwo, eliminating the second test, effectively:

int value;
if (condition)
{
 value = 1;
 One();
}
else
{
 value = 2;
 Two();
}

dotnet/runtime#126812lets this continue through more places where paths rejoin, anddotnet/runtime#127103ensures the rewritten values remain correct in more of those cases.dotnet/runtime#127950carries relationships between values further, so facts likea > 10andb > acan simplify later branches or bounds. The same reasoning can apply to type information.dotnet/runtime#128500combines the known types of instances arriving from multiple paths; if every value derives from the tested base type, the JIT can remove theistest after the paths merge. Anddotnet/runtime#127434from@hez2010lets redundant-branch elimination look through empty jump blocks. Such a block contains no work of its own and exists only to redirect control elsewhere, but it could still hide the relationship between two conditions from the optimizer. Consider this benchmark:

InTransitiveComparison, reachingy > 0means the JIT already knows thatx > 10andy > x, which together prove thatyis positive. The final comparison disappears, reducing the Arm64 method from 40 bytes to 36 bytes:

InMergedTypeCheck, each path creates a different concrete type, but both derive fromShape. .NET 11 keeps the allocations and the store that make the example observable, but replaces theishelper call and its result test with the constanttrue, reducing the method from 112 bytes to 88 bytes:

Removing a redundant branch is ideal; why do work when it’s provably unnecessary? Often, however, the branch is necessary, as both outcomes are possible (or at least not provably impossible). In such cases, the JIT may still be able to avoid branching via specialized instructions that bake the choice into the instruction. “If-conversion” replaces a smallif/elsewith a conditional-move instruction or another branchless form when both alternatives are cheap. The JIT has been able to do this for several releases, and improves in .NET 11.dotnet/runtime#124738from@BoyBaykillerrecognizes an earlier default assignment as the implicitelse, sobool x = false; if (cond) x = true;can become the same branchless form as an explicitelse.dotnet/runtime#127915from@BoyBaykillerhandles the opposite cleanup, removing a conditional selection when both outcomes are the same constant while preserving any side effects from evaluating the condition.dotnet/runtime#128533from@BoyBaykilleralso helps these Boolean optimizations meet in the middle by normalizing power-of-two bit tests. A power of two has exactly one bit set, in which case(A & bit) == bitis equivalent to(A & bit) != 0; putting both forms into the same canonical representation makes them easier to combine with surrounding conditions. All three improvements are visible in the following benchmarks:

}

ForImplicitElse, .NET 10 already avoids a branch, but it still materializes both Boolean values and selects between them. In .NET 11, the method becomes just the comparison and acset, shrinking from 36 bytes to 24 bytes:

0.0.Equals(value)needs to account forNaN, but because the left operand is zero, the case where both operands areNaNcan never apply. Removing the conditional selection for that case leaves one floating-point comparison and onecset, reducingIsDefaultValuefrom 40 bytes to 24 bytes:

Finally, normalizing both power-of-two comparisons lets the JIT combine their results. The short-circuit branch inHasEitherBitis replaced by two masks and anor, reducing the method from 40 bytes to 36 bytes:

Not every simplification depends on broader control-flow reasoning.
“Peephole optimizations” instead replace a short, recognizable pattern with an
equivalent cheaper one. Each may save only an instruction or expose a form
that another optimization understands, but these patterns can occur very
frequently on hot paths throughout generated code. For example,dotnet/runtime#126529from@BoyBaykillerrecognizes that255 - xfor abyteis equivalent tox ^ 255: both simply flip all eight bits, but the latter can remove an instruction if it’s able to replace a negation and add with an xor. Similarly,-1 - xcan turn into the equivalent of~x.

### Vectorization

SIMD, or “single instruction, multiple data”, is the concept of one instruction applying the same operation to several values at once. A “scalar”add, for example, might combine one pair of 32-bit integers, while a 128-bit SIMDaddcan combine “vectors” of four pairs in the same instruction; 256- and 512-bit variants can handle vectors of eight and sixteen pairs, respectively. When the iterations of an operation are independent, “vectorizing” a loop can therefore replace several scalar iterations with one, improving the throughput of the loop significantly.

.NET exposes portable (they work on any machine) variable-width vector typeVector<T>(which can represent different counts ofTdepending on the current hardware), fixed-widthVector64<T>throughVector512<T>types (which always represent the same count ofT), and architecture-specific intrinsics (performing operations on such vector types which the JIT then maps to the right underlying hardware instructions). Each element in a vector is often referred to as a “lane”. Because the JIT recognizes these operations directly, it can fold constants, select instructions, and remove unsupported paths without treating them as normal method calls.

A variety of PRs in .NET 11 improve AVX-512 broadcasting and masking. Embedded broadcasting lets an instruction load a single scalar value and replicate it across all vector lanes, avoiding the need to materialize a full-width vector constant in memory to feed into the instruction. For example, this bitwise AND instruction:

; x64
vpandd zmm0, zmm1, dword ptr [reloc @RWD00] {1to16}

can replace this one:

; x64
vpandd zmm0, zmm1, zmmword ptr [reloc @RWD00]

storing only 4 bytes in the read-only data section rather than 64. Because the broadcast is handled as part of the load, there’s no additional instruction-level latency; the primary benefit is reduced data size and cache footprint.

Embedded masking similarly lets an instruction update only a subset of the lanes. A mask is one bit per vector lane, where each bit indicates whether and how the operation should affect the corresponding lane. Without embedded masking, code often needs to compute every lane and then blend that result with the old value, so folding the mask into the operation can remove both the separate blend and a zero-vector setup.dotnet/runtime#117700from@saucecontrolimproves broadcast selection when an intrinsic’s natural element size differs from its managed vector type. VNNI, the Vector Neural Network Instructions used for small-integer multiply-accumulate operations, and bitwise operations can now use the smallest valid repeated constant, avoiding a full-vector load.

In .NET 11, this results in 12 fewer bytes in the read-only data section, and
12 fewer bytes of constant-pool cache footprint.

+RWD00 dd 01010101h

The fix also impacts embedded masking. For example, withMaskAndpreviously, the AND used a qword broadcast,{1to2}, and a separate blend then moved the masked result, meaning two instructions. Now thatVector128<uint>.Onecan be broadcast at dword granularity, the mask’s element size and the AND’s element size agree, unlocking using the single merged-masked form. This pattern shows up throughout vectorized algorithms that do lots of bitwise manipulation and hashing, including implementations in System.Numerics.Tensors, System.IO.Hashing, and System.Private.CoreLib.

; x64
- vpandq xmm0, xmm0, qword ptr [reloc @RWD00] {1to2}

; Code: 45 → 39 bytes; data: 8 bytes → 4 bytes

ThatMaskAndexample starts as an AND followed by a blend, an operation that
chooses independently for each vector lane whether to take its value from one
input or the other, with the JIT able to fold those two operations together.
Similar opportunities arise with blends more generally. Sometimes the mask or
one of the inputs makes the choice trivial, e.g. an all-ones mask always selects the
same input, so the blend is just a move. If one input is zero, it can often
become anANDorANDN. AVX-512 provides more options still, as constant
masks and zeroing can be encoded directly in the instruction.dotnet/runtime#123146from@saucecontrolmakes these simplifications
consistently across the portable and hardware-specific APIs. A blend with an all-ones mask provides a particularly clear example:

// Run on x64 with AVX-512:
// dotnet run -c Release -f net10.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net10.0 net11.0

### Intrinsics

An intrinsic is a managed API that the JIT recognizes and special-cases. Often that special-casing involves actually replacing calls to the method with custom code that’s behaviorally equivalent but better in some way (faster, smaller, etc.)

As an example,dotnet/runtime#128678improves recognition of generic-math calls toIBinaryNumber<T>.Log2. The method computes the base-2 logarithm of an integer, equivalent to the index of the number’s highest set bit; for example,Log2(16)is4. Previously, the JIT’s normalized integer type lost the signedness needed to import the operation directly as an intrinsic. Inlining the managed implementation could still produce the same optimized code, but when inlining didn’t happen, the managed call remained. In .NET 11, the JIT consults the precise type and imports the operation directly: unsigned and non-negative signed inputs can become leading-zero-count or bit-scan arithmetic, while a negative signed value retains the managed fallback and its exact exception behavior.

Sometimes the JIT has a perfectly good intrinsic lowering but doesn’t recognize a call that should use it.Enum.Equalsfrom a genericT : Enumcontext was a good example. Even though both arguments to the generic helper are strongly typed asT, an enum doesn’t provide anEquals(T)method; it inherits the virtualEnum.Equals(object)implementation. The second argument therefore needs to be boxed to pass it asobject. The receiver is invoked with a constrained virtual call, but because the concrete enum doesn’t override the method itself, it too needs to be boxed to invoke the implementation onSystem.Enum. Thus, what looks like a strongly-typed comparison can end up allocating two boxes and making a virtual call. In .NET 11,dotnet/runtime#122779eliminates this overhead by teaching the JIT to recognize the call and fold it to a direct comparison of the enum’s underlying integer values. For example:

// dotnet run -c Release -f net10.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net10.0 net11.0

Once the JIT knows the callee isEnum.Equalsand knows the exact enum type, it asks the runtime for the underlying integer type and replaces the virtual call with a direct comparison. That in turn makes both box/unbox pairs redundant, and the generated code contains neither allocation. For the six comparisons performed here, .NET 10 creates twelve boxes, totaling 288 bytes. In .NET 11, the helper becomes just the integer comparison, eliminating both the allocations and the virtual dispatch.

NativeAOT had been carrying an equivalent optimization for years, implemented as IL rewriting in ILCompiler that patchesEnum.Equalsto use typed comparisons. With the JIT now handling it, including in NativeAOT’s own use of the JIT (NativeAOT uses the JIT ahead of time rather than just in time),dotnet/runtime#123086deletes that rewriting and its supporting machinery.

dotnet/runtime#127329improves theVector256.SumandVector512.Sumintrinsics. The JIT now performs most of the reduction at full width and combines the per-lane results at the end, avoiding the extracts and duplicate shuffle sequences needed when splitting wide vectors into 128-bit pieces. Anddotnet/runtime#127402extends vector-constant propagation from 128-bit vectors toVector256andVector512. Code that compares a wide vector with a known sentinel can now simplify subsequent uses just as narrower vectors already could. The following benchmark exemplifies both:

// dotnet run -c Release -f net10.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net10.0 net11.0
// Requires AVX2 for the assembly shown below.

}

ForSum, .NET 10 separately reduces each 128-bit half and then adds the two scalar results. In .NET 11, the permutes and adds operate on both halves in parallel as 256-bit instructions, after which only the two already-reduced halves need to be combined:

; x64
 vmovups ymm0, [rcx+28]

; 63 bytes → 39 bytes

TransformWhenKnownuses a deliberately non-repeating constant across its eight lanes. On the branch where the comparison succeeds, .NET 11 can replacevaluewith that constant, fold the vector addition, and determine that element 6 is16. Thevpaddd, extraction, second 32-byte constant, and associated control flow all disappear:

; x64

One of the goals of .NET is that you can write code once and have it run anywhere, optimized for whatever that “anywhere” has to offer. For vectorization, that means providing portable operations whenever the intent is common across instruction sets, while retaining architecture-specific APIs for algorithms that really do need to target a particular machine.

Whenever possible, we want to enable developers to express their algorithms using the portable APIs, and each release of .NET fills additional gaps there. Including .NET 11.dotnet/runtime#129627from@hez2010adds portable APIs for constructing common lane sequences (e.g.[1, 2, 4, 8]or[a, b, a, b]), concatenating half-vectors (the lower halves of[a, b, c, d]and[w, x, y, z]producing[a, b, w, x]), interleaving ([a, b]and[x, y]producing[a, x, b, y]), de-interleaving ([a, x, b, y]producing[a, b]and[x, y]), and reversal ([a, b, c, d]producing[d, c, b, a]), along with their JIT intrinsification. These operations were already expressible, but only verbosely and only if you knew which hardware instruction to reach for, e.g. writingZipby hand meant targeting a platform-specific API likeAdvSimd.Arm64.ZipLow. The new APIs let the code state the transformation and leave instruction selection to the JIT.

Once the intrinsic operation has been recognized, the backend still needs to keep it in a useful vector form while assigning registers and selecting instructions. Vector values are structs, and the JIT will often apply “struct promotion,” tracking a struct’s fields as independent locals so that each can be optimized separately. That’s useful for ordinary structs, but counterproductive when a value is meant to remain in a vector or mask register: splitting it can introduce extra moves and obscure what should be a single whole-value store, particularly after inlining introduces more local stores.dotnet/runtime#128013consistently marks SIMD and mask stores as intrinsic-related across platforms, including 32-bit x86 and x64 mask stores, so those locals remain intact.dotnet/runtime#129563extends that principle to user-defined structs that are bitcast to SIMD types. This trades away struct promotion for those locals, but enables the JIT to preserve their vector representation.

This matters for user-defined numerical types that store the same data as a
hardware vector but expose named fields or domain-specific operations. The
followingVector2Doubleis laid out as two adjacentdoublevalues, so it can
be bitcast toVector128<double>, operated on with SIMD, and bitcast back:

// dotnet run -c Release -f net10.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net10.0 net11.0

 Vector128<double> simdRight = Unsafe.BitCast<Vector2Double, Vector128<double>>(right);
 return Unsafe.BitCast<Vector128<double>, Vector2Double>(simdLeft + simdRight);
 }

 [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]
 private static Vector2Double Add(Vector2Double a, Vector2Double b, Vector2Double c) =>
 a + b + c;
}

In .NET 10, promotion of the intermediate struct sends the first SIMD result
through two stack locations before the second addition. .NET 11 keeps that
value inxmm0, reducing the helper from 52 bytes to 22 bytes:

; x64
-sub rsp, 28
 vmovups xmm0, [rdx]
 vaddpd xmm0, xmm0, [r8]
-vmovaps [rsp], xmm0
-vmovups xmm0, [rsp]
-vmovups [rsp+18], xmm0
-vmovups xmm0, [rsp+18]
 vaddpd xmm0, xmm0, [r9]
 vmovups [rcx], xmm0
 mov rax, rcx
-add rsp, 28
 ret

; 52 bytes → 22 bytes

dotnet/runtime#128350gives the xarch register allocator more freedom around fused multiply-add (FMA) and AVX-512 ternary-logic operations. These instructions can read and overwrite operands in several equivalent arrangements; choosing the arrangement that already matches the surrounding registers avoids otherwise necessary moves.

Generic vector code introduces another wrinkle. Operators likeVector128<T>.operator ==returnbool, so the return type doesn’t reveal the
vector’s element type. The JIT instead needs to obtain that type from the
operands in order to select the right comparison instruction. In some generic
contexts, including helpers built on the internalISimdVectorabstraction,
the JIT was consulting the wrong type information and failed to import the
operator as an intrinsic. It then executed the managed fallback, which compares
the lanes individually.dotnet/runtime#130086marks these operators so their element type is taken from the first argument. As an example, the generic helpers used internally by ordinal-ignore-case string comparer benefit from this.

.NET 11 adds support for newer x86 capabilities while also
improving code generated for existing hardware. These changes benefit both
direct users of hardware intrinsics and portable vector code selected by the
JIT. For example,dotnet/runtime#124114from@saucecontrolimproves 32-bit x86 without AVX-512, where convertinguinttofloatordoublepreviously required a runtime helper. Older x86 conversion instructions accept signed integers, and half of theuintrange doesn’t fit in a signed 32-bit value, which is why the helper existed. The JIT now emits an inline vector-instruction sequence that handles the high bit explicitly, avoiding the call and its register and stack overhead.

// Run with 32-bit x86 dotnet and AVX-512 disabled (DOTNET_EnableAVX512=0)
// dotnet run -c Release -f net10.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net10.0 net11.0

dotnet/runtime#124804from@alexcovingtonadds the AVX-512 Bit Matrix Multiply APIs. A binary matrix treats each bit as an element and combines rows and columns with bitwise operations, not integer multiplication. The instructions are useful in areas such as error correction and CRC computation. Each replaces a much longer sequence of shifts, masks, and exclusive-ORs. Anddotnet/runtime#128365from@jamesburtonaddsAvxVnni.V512, extending the AVX-VNNI APIs from 256-bit to 512-bit operands so the small-integer dot products used by quantized machine-learning models can process 64 bytes per operation instead of 32.

dotnet/runtime#126062from@saucecontrolalso avoids converting a vector selector into an AVX-512 mask register when the eventual operation still needs the vector form. In such cases, the older-looking vector blend is actually shorter and uses fewer resources:

// dotnet run -c Release -f net10.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net10.0 net11.0

In .NET 11, you get the simplervblendvpsform that avoids an unnecessary k-register operation.

; x64
 vmovups xmm0, [rcx+8]
- vpmovd2m k1, xmm0
- vaddps xmm0 {k1}, xmm0, [rcx+18]

+ vblendvps xmm0, xmm0, xmm1, xmm0
 vmovups [rdx], xmm0

; 29 bytes → 24 bytes

The masked EVEX form looks more modern, but when the mask originates from a
vector anyway, the vector-blend sequence is five bytes shorter and avoids
writing a mask register. There are only 8 k-registers, and some
microarchitectures have port contention for instructions that write them.

A compiler’s cost model assigns estimates to operations and instructions, such as their execution cost or throughput and their impact on code size, and uses those estimates to choose between otherwise legal transformations or instruction sequences. Wrong estimates can still produce semantically correct code, just slower or larger code. Withdotnet/runtime#127048, which updates the JIT’s xarch floating-point and SIMD cost model, the JIT’s cost model reflects modern instruction throughput and encoded size, replacing old x87 assumptions and a flat cost for every intrinsic. That leads to better decisions about common-subexpression elimination and loop unrolling, particularly for 512-bit operations.

dotnet/runtime#130422folds a vector lane extraction followed byWithElementinto oneinsertpsthat reads the source lane directly. Code such asdestination.WithElement(0, source.GetElement(2))conceptually extracts a scalar and then inserts it elsewhere.insertps, however, has an immediate operand whose bits select both the source lane and destination lane. The JIT can therefore pass the original source vector to the instruction and encode lane 2 in that immediate, instead of first shuffling lane 2 into the scalar position and then inserting it.

Three more xarch changes tighten public SIMD operations on the hardware where they apply.dotnet/runtime#125666from@alexcovingtonreplaces the dedicated AVX dot-product instruction with a multiply, add, and permute reduction that has better throughput on contemporary cores:

Multiplying vectors of bytes is more involved than multiplying vectors of
larger integer types because x86 doesn’t provide a packed byte-multiply
instruction. The implementation needs to combine wider 16-bit multiplications
while retaining only the low byte of each product. When it couldn’t widen the
whole operation to the next vector size, .NET 10 split the input into two
halves, widened and multiplied each half, narrowed both results, and joined
them again.dotnet/runtime#126348from@saucecontrolinstead separates the even and odd bytes with masks and shifts, performs two 16-bit multiplications over the full vector width, and recombines the low bytes:

Finally,dotnet/runtime#127536from@Ruihan-Yincompletes support for APX, Intel’s Advanced Performance Extensions. In addition to expanding the general-purpose register set, APX adds forms of many instructions that don’t overwrite the processor’s condition flags. That gives the register allocator and instruction scheduler more freedom to keep values and pending conditions alive at the same time. ItsCTESTandCFCMOVinstructions can also represent chained conditions without branches and replace some compare-with-zero forms with shorter encodings. Applications don’t need to call APX-specific APIs to benefit; when the hardware and operating system expose APX, the JIT is able to utilize the additional instructions automatically.

On Arm64, the work in .NET 11 spans both conventional code generation and
continued support for SVE (Scalable Vector Extension). Unlike 128-bit AdvSimd
vectors, an SVE vector doesn’t have one width fixed by the instruction set;
each processor chooses a supported width, and the same compiled loop uses
predicate masks to operate on however many elements fit. That makes SVE well
suited to loops whose trip counts are not exact multiples of a particular
vector size.

dotnet/runtime#121986improves zeroing for larger stack allocations on Arm64. The JIT can store two zeroed 128-bit vector registers at a time, doubling the amount cleared by each instruction:

Instruction selection also improves where values move between registers and memory. In .NET 11,dotnet/runtime#126803changesToScalaron a vector of 64-bit integers to usefmov Xd, Dnrather than the lane-extract instructionumov; in both cases lane zero moves to a general-purpose register, butfmovis the more direct form. For ReadyToRun code,dotnet/runtime#129589folds relocatable indirection-cell loads fromadrp + add + ldrintoadrp + ldr #:lo12:, removing the separate address addition. Anddotnet/runtime#129932re-enablesldp/stpformation for negative unscaled offsets, letting two adjacent loads or stores become one paired instruction.

The first and third changes are easy to see with small methods:

// dotnet run -c Release -f net10.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net10.0 net11.0

using BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes;
using BenchmarkDotNet.Running;
using System.Runtime.CompilerServices;
using System.Runtime.Intrinsics;

BenchmarkSwitcher.FromAssembly(typeof(Benchmarks).Assembly).Run(args);

[DisassemblyDiagnoser, HideColumns("Job", "Error", "StdDev", "Median", "RatioSD")]
public class Benchmarks
{
 private Vector128<long> _vector = Vector128.Create(42L, 84L);
 private nint[] _storage = new nint[8];

 [Benchmark]
 public long ToScalar() => ToScalarCore(_vector);

 [Benchmark]
 public void ClearPrevious() => ClearPreviousCore(ref _storage[4]);

 [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]
 private static long ToScalarCore(Vector128<long> value) => value.ToScalar();

 [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]
 private static void ClearPreviousCore(ref nint value)
 {
 Unsafe.Add(ref value, -1) = 0;
 Unsafe.Add(ref value, -2) = 0;
 Unsafe.Add(ref value, -3) = 0;
 Unsafe.Add(ref value, -4) = 0;
 }
}

TheToScalarchange is a direct instruction substitution, while the negative-offset stores collapse from four instructions to two, reducing the helper from 32 bytes to 24 bytes:

; Arm64
; ToScalarCore
- umov x0, v0.d[0]
+ fmov x0, d0

; ClearPreviousCore
- str xzr, [x0, #-0x08]
- str xzr, [x0, #-0x10]
- str xzr, [x0, #-0x18]
- str xzr, [x0, #-0x20]
+ stp xzr, xzr, [x0, #-0x10]
+ stp xzr, xzr, [x0, #-0x20]

Bit-counting operations benefit as well.PopCountcounts the one bits in a value, whileTrailingZeroCountcounts the zero bits below its least-significant one bit.dotnet/runtime#128677imports both as dedicated Arm64 intrinsics, making their intent visible to later optimization. On processors with the FEAT_CSSC extension,dotnet/runtime#130332can then lower them directly to the scalarcntandctzinstructions.

Comparison masks are another place where spelling out the intent enables much better code. Portable SIMD code often compares vectors, callsExtractMostSignificantBits, and then asks whether any lane matched, counts matching lanes, or finds the first or last match.dotnet/runtime#129688from@jonathandavies-armrecognizes those consumers on Arm64 and avoids materializing the full scalar mask: it can horizontally reduce the vector mask directly.

On the SVE and SVE2 side,dotnet/runtime#129852from@snickolls-armremoves the old 128-bit size ceiling forVector<T>on Arm64 and lets the runtime size the type from the process’s actual SVE vector length. (ScalableVector<T>remains experimental and disabled by default in .NET 11, so this expands what the experimental mode can do; it doesn’t speed up the defaultVector<T>configuration.)

The public intrinsic surface also grows. In .NET 11,dotnet/runtime#118957from@SwapnilGaikwadexposes odd-lane floating-point conversions; “odd lane” here means converting elements 1, 3, 5, and so on, which is useful when widening or narrowing interleaved data.dotnet/runtime#123890from@ylpoonlganddotnet/runtime#123892from@ylpoonlgadd non-temporal gather loads and scatter stores, which read from or write to multiple non-contiguous addresses (the “gather” part) while hinting that the data need not remain in cache (the “non-temporal” part).

Other changes improve the predicates that make scalable loops work.dotnet/runtime#127538adds hardware-generated predicate masks for more loop and memory-access patterns, whiledotnet/runtime#126398from@ylpoonlgreduces setup moves for masked operations. Anddotnet/runtime#128326from@snickolls-armimproves how SVE masks flow through the JIT, allowing zeroing forms of instructions to replace separate constant setup.dotnet/runtime#127520from@a74nhenables scalable vector and mask constants, anddotnet/runtime#128148from@snickolls-armuses vector stores to initialize scalable vector locals, replacing scalar loops.

### Register Allocation

Generated code constantly moves values between the CPU’s limited set of fast registers and temporary stack slots. Register allocation in a compiler decides which values stay in registers and which are “spilled” to the stack; avoiding one spill can remove both the store and the later reload.

Some small structs are passed with multiple fields packed into one register. In .NET 11,dotnet/runtime#112740lets the JIT extract those fields directly, avoiding a “spill” to a temporary stack slot followed by a reload of each field:

// dotnet run -c Release -f net10.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net10.0 net11.0

using BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes;
using BenchmarkDotNet.Running;
using System.Drawing;
using System.Runtime.CompilerServices;

BenchmarkSwitcher.FromAssembly(typeof(Benchmarks).Assembly).Run(args);

[HideColumns("Job", "Error", "StdDev", "Median", "RatioSD")]
public class Benchmarks
{
 private readonly Memory<int>[] _memories = CreateMemories();

 private static Memory<int>[] CreateMemories()
 {
 Random rng = new(42);
 var memories = new Memory<int>[4096];
 for (int i = 0; i < memories.Length; i++)
 memories[i] = new int[rng.Next(0, 20)];

 return memories;
 }

 [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]
 private static bool Test(Memory<int> mem) => mem.Length > 10;

 [Benchmark]
 public int MemoryLengthExtract_Loop()
 {
 int count = 0;
 for (int i = 0; i < _memories.Length; i++)
 if (Test(_memories[i]))
 count++;

 return count;
 }
}

The measured row usesMemory<int>because its length arrives packed into part of an argument register on Arm64. The new extraction avoids a stack round-trip on every call.

Two broader register-allocation changes reduce unnecessary copies and spills:dotnet/runtime#125214handles more conflicts directly, whiledotnet/runtime#125219steers short-lived values away from registers an upcoming operation will overwrite.dotnet/runtime#126552from@SingleAccretionremoves an old restriction on method prologs, eliminating jumps that existed only to satisfy that encoding rule.

### Write Barriers and Garbage Collection

The .NET garbage collector is generational: new objects start in gen0, while objects that survive collections are promoted to gen1 and gen2. That enables the GC to collect younger generations without having to scan the whole heap. Of course, a reference to a younger object could get written to a field of an older one, in which case only scanning the younger generation would lead to problems. To ensure such references aren’t missed, whenever a write could create one, the JIT emits a small piece of code to update the GC’s bookkeeping; that code is known as a GC write barrier. Reference writes happen a lot, so it’s really important for performance that those barriers be as cheap as possible, and elided if they’re provably not needed at all.

Managed reference stores may require both an array covariance check and a GC write barrier. Arrays in .NET are covariant, meaning aTDerived[]can be used as aTBase[], e.g. astring[]can be used as anobject[]; consequently, storing an instance into anobject[]must validate that the instance is actually of the right type (otherwise, you could have aTDerived1[]masquerading as aTBase[]and try to store aTDerived2into it, which would cause badness if it were to store successfully).dotnet/runtime#126547expands calls to the runtime’s array-store helper into the individual operations it performs, exposing both the covariance check and write barrier to the JIT. When the JIT knows the array’s exact type, it can then eliminate the covariance check and optimize the barrier:

Sometimes writes are done one at a time, but sometimes they can be batched, as happens when copying structs.dotnet/runtime#128238extends the JIT’s heap-destination analysis from individual stores to whole-struct copies.dotnet/runtime#128542then replaces a specialized helper that copied one reference field at a time with reference stores and vector stores for the non-reference data. Together, they let the JIT choose more efficient write barriers and copy the rest of a mixed struct with SIMD.

dotnet/runtime#130535handles the equivalent case for small structs that don’t contain object references. Once the JIT has turned the copy into several writes to adjacent fields, it can combine them into fewer, wider writes.

// dotnet run -c Release -f net10.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net10.0 net11.0

using BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes;
using BenchmarkDotNet.Running;
using System.Runtime.CompilerServices;

public class Benchmarks
{
 private Int128 _value;

 [Benchmark]
 public void StoreInt128() => _value = 123456789;
}

.NET 10 stores the low and high halves separately. .NET 11 loads the value into a vector register and writes all 16 bytes at once.

; x64
; StoreInt128
- mov qword ptr [rcx+8], 75BCD15
- xor eax, eax
- mov [rcx+10], rax
+ vmovss xmm0, dword ptr [RWD00]
+ vmovups [rcx+8], xmm0

-; Total bytes of code 15
+; Total bytes of code 14

The same idea applies when the source code assigns neighboring fields
individually.dotnet/runtime#126562enables this for promoted struct locals, whiledotnet/runtime#130107extends it to adjacent fields at constant static addresses:

// dotnet run -c Release -f net11.0 --filter "*"

using BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes;
using BenchmarkDotNet.Running;
using System.Runtime.CompilerServices;

BenchmarkSwitcher.FromAssembly(typeof(Benchmarks).Assembly).Run(args);

[DisassemblyDiagnoser, HideColumns("Job", "Error", "StdDev", "Median", "RatioSD")]

{
 private static Point s_point;

 [Benchmark]
 public void SetPoint() => Set();

 [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining | MethodImplOptions.AggressiveOptimization)]
 private static void Set()
 {
 s_point.X = 1;
 s_point.Y = 2;
 }

 private struct Point
 {
 public int X;
 public int Y;
 }
}

The referenced .NET 11 x64 build combines the two 32-bit constants and writes
both fields with one 64-bit store:

; x64
mov rax, 200000001
mov rcx, <address of s_point>
mov [rcx], rax

dotnet/runtime#127487applies a related improvement when stack protection requires a struct parameter to be copied. It uses consistently sized writes so a subsequent wider read doesn’t need to wait for the processor to reconcile overlapping stores.

Write barriers are only one part of the interaction between generated code
and the garbage collector. During a compacting collection, the GC needs to
plan where surviving objects will move and then update references to them. To
do that efficiently, it records their addresses, sorts those addresses, and
groups adjacent survivors into regions called “plugs.” With enough live
objects, sorting these mark lists becomes a meaningful part of the collection.
Recent x86/x64 runtimes use a vectorizedvxsortimplementation for
sufficiently large lists. In .NET 11,dotnet/runtime#110692from@a74nhextends that support to Arm64.

The generation assigned to GC metadata matters just as much as the speed of
one collection. .NET’s generational GC is based on the observation that most
objects die young: generation 0 and generation 1 collections, collectively
called ephemeral collections, run frequently and should avoid revisiting
state that has already survived into generation 2. A dependent handle
associates a primary object with a secondary object, keeping the secondary
alive while the primary remains reachable;ConditionalWeakTable<TKey, TValue>is built on this mechanism. Previously, the handle itself didn’t age
with its referents, so every ephemeral collection continued scanning it even
after both objects had become long-lived.dotnet/runtime#78746ages
dependent handles accordingly and moves a handle back to a younger generation
when necessary. Old handles can therefore be skipped by young collections
without compromising reachability.

### Runtime Knowledge and Frozen Data

The JIT can optimize only the facts it knows. Some facts come from its own analysis; others are contracts supplied by the runtime, such as which helpers have side effects, the length of a newly allocated string, or whether a data object will ever move.

A generic virtual call such asbaseReference.Foo<string>()may need help from the runtime to find the implementation for both the object’s actual type and the generic argument. If that lookup appears to have arbitrary side effects, the JIT has to perform it exactly where it occurs, rather than possibly resulting on a cached answer from a previous lookup. In .NET 11,dotnet/runtime#122017teaches the JIT more precisely which exceptions these runtime helpers can throw and whether they otherwise have side effects. The JIT can then share repeated lookups or move an unchanging lookup out of a loop:

// dotnet run -c Release -f net10.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net10.0 net11.0

using BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes;
using BenchmarkDotNet.Running;
using System.Runtime.CompilerServices;

BenchmarkSwitcher.FromAssembly(typeof(Benchmarks).Assembly).Run(args);

[HideColumns("Job", "Error", "StdDev", "Median", "RatioSD")]
public class Benchmarks
{
 public abstract class Base
 {
 public abstract void Foo<T>();

 public class Derived : Base
 {
 public override void Foo<T>() { }
 }

 private Base _b = new Derived();

 [Benchmark]

 b.Foo<int>();
 b.Foo<string>();
 b.Foo<int>();

 for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
 b.Foo<double>();
 }
}

In .NET 11, the repeated lookups outside the loop are shared and the loop’s lookup is performed once, not ten times.

Profile data is another way the JIT learns what matters. Inlining could previously hide important work from the instrumentation used to gather that data.dotnet/runtime#119658allows the inlined code to be instrumented as well, giving later PGO-driven compilation a more complete picture of the hot paths.

### JIT Throughput and Cleanup

The quality of the generated code isn’t the only concern; the time spent producing it matters too. Every analysis the JIT performs has a cost.dotnet/runtime#123856removes checks and maps from Global Assertion Propagation whose bookkeeping wasn’t paying for itself. This is the recurring balancing act in the development of the JIT: retaining the information that enables meaningful optimizations while avoiding analysis overhead whose code-quality benefit is negligible.

dotnet/runtime#127363makes profile-guided optimization more resilient with OSR (on-stack replacement), which replaces a method while one of its loops is already running. Because that execution begins in the middle of the method rather than at its normal entry, reconstructed profile data doesn’t always line up perfectly with the paths actually available. The JIT now estimates the likelihood of those paths rather than asserting or abandoning the profile.

Optimizations can leave behind code that’s no longer reachable, so the JIT also needs to be good at dead code removal.dotnet/runtime#126223runs another sweep whenever the method’s branching structure changes, catching blocks made obsolete by earlier transformations.

Anddotnet/runtime#128515from@BoyBaykillerrepeatedly combines equivalent return and throw endings, removing duplicate exit paths and sometimes exposing more code that can be shared.

// dotnet run -c Release -f net10.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net10.0 net11.0

using BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes;
using BenchmarkDotNet.Running;

 [Benchmark]
 [Arguments((byte)9)]
 public bool IsLinearWhiteSpace(byte value) =>
 value <= 32 &&
 (value == 32 || value == 10 || value == 13 || value == 9);
}

In .NET 10, tail merging combines the paths that returnfalse, but not both paths that returntrue. As a result, the JIT’s bit test covers three of the four values, with a separate comparison for9. In .NET 11, the true returns are merged as well, enabling all four values to be handled by the same bit test:

; x64
- movzx ecx, dl
- cmp ecx, 20
- jg M00_L02
- cmp ecx, 20
- ja M00_L01
- mov eax, 0FFFFDBFF

+ mov eax, 1
+ ret
+M00_L00:
 xor eax, eax
 ret

-; Total bytes of code 43
+; Total bytes of code 33

Also related to dead code, a call that never returns, such as one that always throws, makes everything after it unreachable. In .NET 11, after inlining,dotnet/runtime#128513removes the remaining statements and outgoing paths from such a block and marks it as ending in a throw, exposing the dead code early enough for the cleanup passes above to remove it.

## Startup and Deployment

Before managedMaincan run, the native host needs to locate the application’s dependencies, CoreCLR needs to load enough types and code to begin execution, and various pieces of framework infrastructure need to initialize themselves. Work removed from any of those stages helps the application get going sooner, improving startup time.

The host starts by reading the application’s.deps.json, turning its entries into paths, and building the trusted platform assembly (TPA) list. That list tells CoreCLR which framework and application assemblies it can resolve by simple name. Several costs in this process scaled with the number of assets rather than with the amount of useful work.dotnet/runtime#123568in .NET 11 avoids checking every asset against a servicing directory unless the resolver is actually probing that directory.dotnet/runtime#123919avoids repeatedly comparing the servicing-directory name and copying every dependency asset while constructing the TPA list, avoiding a lot of allocation.dotnet/runtime#125251removes more allocation by normalizing each asset’s directory separators once when parsing the.deps.json, rather than normalizing the path again every time it is used.

Once the host hands off to CoreCLR, ReadyToRun (R2R) code helps avoid compiling methods before they can execute. However, initializingComparer<T>.DefaultandEqualityComparer<T>.Defaultcalled a reflection-based helper whose resulting concrete comparer type wasn’t known when the R2R image was built. The comparer constructor and operations could consequently fall back to being interpreted. In .NET 11,dotnet/runtime#126204uses specialized helpers that R2R can compile ahead of time and ensures the required comparer types are included in the image.

Even better than making initialization faster is avoiding it altogether. AnEventSourcenormally discovers its event metadata and computes its provider GUID when it is initialized.dotnet/runtime#121180adds an internal source generator that performs this work when the framework is built and emits the result for itsEventSourceimplementations, including the ones for core runtime tracing. Applications then don’t need to pay the reflection and setup costs when those event sources are first used.

Startup also has a memory footprint outside the managed heap. Native AOT’sAllocHeaptypically holds only small amounts of runtime metadata. On Windows, however, its virtual-memory allocator reserved a 64 KB region for each block even when it initially needed only 4 KB. In .NET 11,dotnet/runtime#122822instead uses ordinarynewanddeletefor these small blocks, matching the allocation strategy to the amount of memory normally involved.

Note that the aforementioned R2R work wasn’t motivated only by desktop and server startup. It was also
part of the substantial effort to make CoreCLR the runtime for .NET on mobile.
Starting with .NET 11,.NET MAUI moved to CoreCLRfor Android, iOS, and Mac Catalyst, the last .NET MAUI platforms that had still
been using Mono. This is much more than swapping one execution engine for another. Those apps
now use the same runtime as ASP.NET Core, cloud services, and desktop .NET,
with the same JIT, garbage collector, diagnostics infrastructure, performance improvements, and bug fixes.
It also brings CoreCLR’s tiered compilation, ReadyToRun, and profile-guided
optimization to mobile, while providing a common foundation for NativeAOT.
That combination is important: R2R and packaged profiles can precompile the
code most important to startup, while the optimizing JIT can produce
higher-quality code for hot methods on platforms where dynamic compilation is
available. Improvements like the comparer specialization mentioned earlier keep more code
on the compiled path instead of falling back to interpretation.

## Threading

Threading is a cross-cutting concern that impacts almost every
application and service. Whether code is protecting shared state, queueing work, or
coordinating asynchronous operations, small costs in the underlying machinery
can quickly add up. As such, it’s something that’s revisited in every release of .NET.

Monitoris the synchronization primitive historically used to implementlock, providing the most pervasively used support for mutual exclusion. It also supports sending signals, such that one thread can wait on aMonitorwithMonitor.Waitfor another thread toPulseit. The internal object that tracks these waiters is a “condition variable.”dotnet/runtime#129083stores that condition directly on the lock, removing a separateConditionalWeakTablelookup from this already synchronization-heavy path.

In the case ofMonitor, that improvement targeted the specific shared implementation. In other cases, the costs are spread out in a more peanut butter manner across lots of code.dotnet/runtime#125274removes some of that peanut butter by removing unnecessaryvolatileannotations from a wide range of library fields whose correctness already comes from locks,Interlocked, or one-time initialization. On x86/x64 hardware, which already provides a strong memory model, those annotations generally don’t result in extra instructions, though they can still constrain compiler optimizations. Arm, however, permits more reordering, so the JIT often needs to emit memory fences to providevolatile‘s guarantees. Removing the annotations where they’re redundant therefore can end up removing unnecessary fences from Arm’s generated code.

Similar considerations apply to code in the runtime.dotnet/runtime#125259replaces
full memory barriers in the runtime’sHashMapwith the narrower acquire and
release operations actually required. On top of that, many VM
hash tables, including itsEEHashTable, are read constantly but updated only
occasionally.dotnet/runtime#124822adds epoch-based reclamation, enabling readers to avoid entering cooperative
GC mode simply to keep an old set of buckets alive. Anddotnet/runtime#129640replaces
the previous byte-at-a-time hash used by these tables with an xxHash
implementation that consumes four bytes at a time.

Along the same lines, in .NET 11dotnet/runtime#122726reduces the scheduling overhead around small thread-pool work items. It removes unnecessary memory fences and shared-state updates, checks in with the thread-pool controller once per batch rather than once per item, spends less time spinning on a semaphore, and requests another worker only when the queued work shows one is needed. The result is less coordination overhead and fewer workers woken just as the queue becomes empty.

Earlier in this post, we talked about runtime async, which can have a significant impact on the performance ofasync/awaitcode, how they produceTasks, and so on. They’re not the only improvements in .NET 11 related toTasks, though.

One fun one is a new analyzer, CA2027, introduced indotnet/sdk#51452. With that, the SDK can point out problematic usage ofTask.Delaythat I’ve seen on multiple occasions to lead to non-trivial performance issues in large scale services. Consider this code:

Task someTask = ...;
if (await Task.WhenAny(someTask, Task.Delay(timeout)) != someTask) // oops!
{
 throw new TimeoutException();
}

The developer that wrote this is obviously trying to implement a timeout. The problem, however, is that this leaks. In the hopefully common case wheresomeTaskcompletes really quickly, theTask.Delaywill still be pending. ThatDelayhas associated with it aSystem.Threading.Timerthat’s consuming valuable resources, as well as other data in memory, and if thistimeoutis long and this code is on a hotter path, we could accumulate thousands upon thousands of those timers. That in turn can increase memory use and slow down other calls that interact with timers.

The fix is to instead use theTask.WaitAsyncmethod, introduced all the way back in .NET 6. It provides a much more efficient mechanism for doing this same kind of timed waiting, and it correctly handles all the relevant cleanup. CA2027 will detect common forms of this issue and recommend the replacement.

## Numerics

BigIntegeris one of those types that many applications may never need, but
for those that do, there’s often no practical substitute. It powers workloads
ranging from cryptography and number theory to compilers and applications that
need to parse, format, or compute with integers larger than the fixed-width
primitives can hold. Despite that need, however,BigIntegerhasn’t received the
same steady stream of performance investment as many of .NET’s other core
types. Thankfully, in .NET 11 it gets a makeover.

dotnet/runtime#125799rewrote significant portions ofBigInteger‘s implementation, changing its limbs (the fixed-size pieces stored in its backing array) fromuinttonuint(UIntPtr). That makes no effective difference on a 32-bit machine. On a 64-bit machine, however, each limb grows from 32 to 64 bits; since most arithmetic on a 64-bit value on a 64-bit platform costs no more than the corresponding 32-bit operation, each step can therefore process twice as many bits in the same number of cycles. The implementation also improves the algorithms around those wider limbs, including Montgomery multiplication and sliding-window exponentiation inModPow, fused bitwise steps, additional hardware intrinsics, loop unrolling, and caching. That all builds on top of other optimizations that were done previously in the release, such as faster conversion of huge values to decimal text indotnet/runtime#112178from@kzrnm,dotnet/runtime#112876from@kzrnmusing Toom-Cook multiplication for sufficiently large operands, and improved shifts and rotations thanks todotnet/runtime#113005from@kzrnm. Toom-Cook splits each operand into several chunks and combines smaller products, doing less work than the straightforward every-limb-by-every-limb algorithm once the operands are large enough.

In addition to internal changes,BigIntegeralso gained new public APIs that avoid transcoding. Protocols and storage formats increasingly expose text as UTF-8 bytes, but the previous parsing and formatting APIs required UTF-16 characters. Callers therefore had to decode the input into a temporary string before parsing, or format into characters and encode the result back to bytes.dotnet/runtime#117745adds direct UTF-8 parsing and formatting to bothBigIntegerandComplex, sharing the generic numeric machinery used for UTF-16 and letting those consumers operate on their original representation.

dotnet/runtime#130721improves a differentBigIntegerboundary: casting todoubleandfloat. The general conversion needs to inspect the arbitrary-width magnitude, locate its highest set bits, and perform the rounding required by the target floating-point format. But manyBigIntegerinstances are much smaller than that machinery is designed for… the implementation now recognizes values that fit in 64 bits and routes them through the hardware’s native integer conversion support.

The same limb-widening advantages given toBigIntegerin .NET 11 were also extended to the core floating-point types. Parsing a very long decimal input and formatting a floating-point value with many requested digits both need temporary arbitrary-precision arithmetic once the value no longer fits in the normal mantissa. .NET uses a separate internalNumber.BigIntegerfor that work.dotnet/runtime#132577applies the same native-width limb representation to that type, reducing the amount of per-limb work in floating-point parsing, formatting, and rounding.

TensorPrimitivesalso picked up a few more targeted SIMD improvements. For floating-point values,BitIncrementandBitDecrementmove to the immediately adjacent representable value; despite their names, they can’t simply add or subtract one, as they also need to handle signed zero, infinities, and NaNs correctly.dotnet/runtime#123610anddotnet/runtime#123754process multiplefloat/doubleandHalfvalues at once, respectively. TheHalfpath works directly with the rawushortbit patterns, avoiding conversion tofloatand back, and both paths use vector masks and conditional selection rather than calling a scalar helper for every element.

Halfcomparisons are faster as well. Previously,Half.CompareToseparately

repeating the special handling required for NaN and signed zero each time.dotnet/runtime#131297performs
that work once and then arranges the underlying bits into a form that can be

tofloat, which the hardware can do very efficiently. Equality remains
bit-based, as that’s already the cheaper approach.

Guidhas been improving every .NET release, and sees several improvements in .NET 11. Whenever possible, .NET tries to maintain similar performance and behaviors across operating systems, but low-level functionality often simply delegates to the operating system, exposing that OS’ characteristics. When it comes to random number generation, historically cryptographically-secure random number generation, as is used inGuid.NewGuid, has been a bit slower on Linux than on Windows due to using/dev/urandomas the source of entropy.dotnet/runtime#123540from@reedzmovesGuid.NewGuid()off of that file-descriptor path to thegetrandom()syscall, avoiding descriptor setup and reads through the file abstraction.

And on the subject of randomness,dotnet/runtime#119890from@hamarb123removes two pieces of work fromRandom.Shuffle: an unnecessary copy of the span length and a branch that skipped swapping an element with itself. A self-swap is harmless and uncommon, while testing for it adds an unpredictable branch to every iteration. The difference is most visible for short arrays and small value types, where the swap itself is cheap:

Randomitself picked up a small but pointed code-generation fix.Random.InternalSamplecontains a condition that’s inherently hard for the processor to predict, so it’s better implemented with conditional instructions than with a branch. The JIT’s if-conversion support we previously discussed would have been able to do that transformation, except it doesn’t currently support if-conversion inside of loops, which is a pretty common place to find an inlinedRandom.Nextcall.dotnet/runtime#131714marks the helper as[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]to preserve the branch-free form; once the JIT can perform if-conversion inside loops, that annotation can be reconsidered.

## Globalization

Many globalization-related APIs sit atop data that can be expensive to locate
and interpret.DateTime.Now, for example, depends on time-zone transition
data, while casing and parsing depend on native globalization services and
culture-specific tables.

dotnet/runtime#119662substantially reworksTimeZoneInfoaround that observation. Determining an offset isn’t always a fixed arithmetic operation: daylight-saving rules can vary by year, and historical rules can contain multiple transitions and exceptional cases. Once the transitions for a zone and year have been interpreted, however, other conversions in that year can reuse them. Similarly, the local offset used byDateTime.Nowcan’t change between transition instants. Conversions now reuse cached per-year transition data rather than repeatedly walking adjustment rules, whileDateTime.Nowcaches the active UTC offset together with the instant at which it next needs to be recomputed.

dotnet/runtime#120685separates two costs in invariant casing. With the normal globalization configuration,ToUpperInvariantandToLowerInvariantnow try a managed ASCII path first, so casing ASCII text can avoid or delay initialization of ICU, the native library .NET uses for culture-aware globalization. In invariant-globalization mode, where ICU isn’t loaded at all, that managed path also improves ASCII casing throughput. Non-ASCII input still needs the appropriate globalization path.

Several smaller changes remove setup around date and culture data.dotnet/runtime#123886allocates theDateTimeFormatInfodate-word table only for cultures that actually contain such words. Anddotnet/runtime#122918replaces synchronized, boxingHashtablecaches used by time-zone and encoding tables with typedConcurrentDictionaryinstances.

The round-trip"O"date format always contains exactly seven fractional-second digits, matching the 10,000,000 ticks in a second.dotnet/runtime#129005parses those digits directly as ticks, avoiding a conversion throughdoublefollowed by division, multiplication, and rounding. Formatting benefits from specialization as well.dotnet/runtime#129374routes invariantDateTime.ToString("G")through the existing fixed-format fast path, bypassing the general culture-aware formatter.DateTimeOffsetretains the general path because its offset changes the output:

## Strings and Spans

UTF-8 is everywhere, from web protocols and JSON payloads to files on disk.
Since .NET strings use UTF-16, applications frequently need to convert between
the two, making it especially important for those conversions to be fast.
UTF-8 encoding must validate UTF-16 surrogate pairs as it counts and converts
them. On Arm64, the vectorized implementation in .NET 10 still examined
individual elements when counting the resulting UTF-8 bytes and checking that
surrogates were correctly paired. That gets expensive for text containing many
supplementary characters, as every surrogate-heavy vector falls back to this
element-by-element work.dotnet/runtime#121981from@ylpoonlginstead performs the counting and
surrogate checks with vector-wide operations. As part of that work, it also
unifies most of the x86 and Arm64 implementations, retaining small
platform-specific helpers where the instruction sets differ:

// dotnet run -c Release -f net10.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net10.0 net11.0

using BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes;
using BenchmarkDotNet.Running;
using System.Text;

BenchmarkSwitcher.FromAssembly(typeof(Benchmarks).Assembly).Run(args);

 sb.Append("\U0001F600"); // emoji -> surrogate pair
 }

 _validWithSurrogatePairs = sb.ToString();
 }

 [Benchmark]
 public int ValidWithSurrogatePairs() => Encoding.UTF8.GetByteCount(_validWithSurrogatePairs);
}

This input deliberately contains a surrogate pair for every ASCII character,
making the removed per-element work especially visible.

The byte-to-char direction was also improved on Arm. UTF-8 decoding can copy ASCII bytes directly to UTF-16 characters, but as soon as we find the first non-ASCII byte, we need the full multi-byte decoder. The vector loop therefore needs both a fast test for whether any lane is non-ASCII and, only when one is found, its exact position. Calculating that position for every all-ASCII vector wastes work on the overwhelmingly common fast path.dotnet/runtime#121382from@ylpoonlgfirst performs the cheap vector-wide test and then computes the lane index only after that test succeeds.

Base64 is commonly used when binary data needs to travel through
text-oriented formats and protocols. Its encoder naturally works in groups of
three input bytes and four output characters, but the line-breaking option
also needs to stop at the MIME-style 76-character boundary and insert\r\n.
The older implementation handled that formatting through a separate scalar
path.dotnet/runtime#123403brings the optimized span-based Base64 encoder toConvert.ToBase64StringwithBase64FormattingOptions.InsertLineBreaks, processing each line with the same vectorized core and handling the separators around it:

Base64 decoding got the same treatment from the other direction.Base64.DecodeFromUtf8InPlacedecodes in place, overwriting the encoded input with the decoded bytes. In .NET 10, it still employed a scalar loop, long after the out-of-placeDecodeFromUtf8had acquired AVX-512, AVX2, AdvSimd, and SSSE3 paths. In-place decoding turns out to be safe to vectorize precisely because of Base64’s ratio: 4 bytes read produce 3 bytes written, so the write cursor always trails the read cursor, and each vector store, including its zero-padded overshoot, ends at or before the next vector load and never clobbers source that hasn’t been read yet.dotnet/runtime#131333therefore reuses the existing decode helpers for the in-place path.

MemoryExtensions.CommonPrefixLengthcompares two spans and returns how many
elements they share at the beginning (“hello” and “help”, for example, have a
common prefix length of 3). Internally, it utilizes a helper that slices whichever input was longer to
the length of the shorter one.dotnet/runtime#121104from@xtqqczzesimplifies that helper: after
shortening the second span if necessary, it always slices the first span to
the second’s length. That gives the JIT the same explicit relationship between
the two lengths regardless of which input started out longer.

Text processing often starts by obtaining anEncoding. Properties such asEncoding.UTF8provide fast access to popular encodings, while legacy code
pages can be made available by registeringCodePagesEncodingProvider. In

Some of my favorite improvements in .NET are the tiny ones that show up everywhere. A good example of that is indotnet/roslyn#82729. Previously, when you wrotespan[start..], the compiler would lower that to the equivalent ofspan.Slice(start, span.Length - start). The JIT has made strides towards compiling this exactly how it wouldspan.Slice(start), but everyone is better off if the C# compiler just emits that in the first place. And it now does. The difference is clear in the IL for a method that returnsspan[start..]:

; Platform-independent IL

+// After: 9 bytes

### Searching and Comparing

Searching in one way, shape, or form is one of the most common things programs do. And when it comes to searching text, regular expressions are an extremely common and helpful way to specify and perform said search. .NET’s regex support has improved by leaps and bounds over the years, with significant investments in .NET 5 and .NET 7 and then every release since, including .NET 11.

When aRegexinstance is created, it needs to parse the incoming regular expression pattern and turn it into a form it can utilize for performing the actual searches. The regex language is very expressive and enables multiple ways of specifying the same pattern, some more efficient to process than others, so as part of parsing,Regexapplies a variety of simplifications and optimizations over the parsed tree in order to put it into an ideal form, as well as to learn facts about the pattern to further optimize later processing (such as discovering a minimum and maximum length of any possible match). Each of these transformations can in turn expose more opportunity for other transformations, but based on the order the transformations are applied, sometimes those opportunities can be missed. In .NET 11,dotnet/runtime#125289gives compiled and source-generated regexes one final cleanup pass after the whole-pattern optimizations have reshaped the pattern. Consider the pattern[ab]+c[ab]+|[ab]+. On input containing a long run ofas with noc, the .NET 10 source-generated matcher first scans the whole run for the first alternative, fails when it doesn’t find thec, and then scans the same run again for the second alternative. The final cleanup pass factors out the common[ab]+, leavingc[ab]+as an optional suffix:

Beyond doing additional passes, several other changes improve what those
analysis passes can see. For example, for a pattern like(http|https)with
ordinal ignore-case matching, for uninteresting reasons previously the engine
would extract a prefix of"htt", even though it could have extracted"http".dotnet/runtime#124881improves that, enabling the engine to skip far more false candidates. The
input here contains 25,000"htt"prefixes that aren’t followed by apbefore the final match:

When those transformation passes are looking for various patterns, sometimes small
things obscure what they’re trying to see, and they miss optimizations.dotnet/runtime#124842improves a case where captures were getting in the way of identifying a

As these cases highlight, one of the most impactful things we can do for regular expression processing is improve the engine’s ability to find things to search for as the next possible place a match could apply, and to optimize that search.dotnet/runtime#124736does that. For compiled, source-generated, andNonBacktrackingregexes, it improves how the engine is able to search for one of several literal prefixes. Foragggtaaa|tttaccct, for example, the .NET 10 source generator first searched for[ag]at offset 3 and then checked nearby characters for[gt]. That’s a weak filter for an input full ofacharacters, where almost every position becomes a candidate. The .NET 11 generator instead searches for the completeagggtaaaandtttaccctstrings withSearchValues<string>. A frequency heuristic selects this approach only for case-sensitive alternatives where whole-string searching is expected to reject more false candidates than the available character-set filter.

Of course, searching for the next place to match isn’t the only opportunity for improvement. Once you’ve found that place, you need to try to match, and we want to optimize that further, too.

Consider the pattern\b\w+n\b. The\w+can matchn, which means we can’t automatically treat this loop as being atomic. Normally, after matching the loop greedily and failing to matchn, we’d need to backtrack looking for the next viable place to match then. But if what comes after then(in this case, a boundary) can’t possibly match the loop, we can avoid doing that search.dotnet/runtime#125636teaches the compiled and source-generated engines to prove that and test the final position directly rather than searching backward through the loop’s existing match. The same idea applies to other loops followed by a literal when the engine can prove that trying earlier positions can’t change the result.

A match can sometimes be ruled out before examining any of the input’s
characters. When matching starts at position zero, a fixed-length pattern with
a leading\Aor non-multiline^and a trailing\zcan match only when the
whole input has exactly that length.dotnet/runtime#120916emits
that length check up front for the compiled and source-generated engines when
the computed maximum length equals the minimum required length. Here, the
pattern requires exactly 512 characters while the input contains 513:

In general, we’ve tried to keep the compilers behindRegexOptions.Compiled(which emits IL) and the source generator (which emits C#) as close to 1:1 as possible. There are a few cases, however, where they have diverged from each other, generally where one was able to easily utilize some feature of the target language the other didn’t have. A good example is with alternations. If several left-to-right atomic branches each begin with a different literal character, the engine can read that character and jump straight to the matching branch rather than testing each branch in order. With C#, we emitted aswitch, which the C# compiler could then lower to IL using various strategies. For IL, in .NET 10 and earlier, without the C# compiler to provide those optimizations, we just skipped the optimization. Now in .NET 11,dotnet/runtime#122959emits a similar implementation to what the C# compiler would have, bringing this optimization toRegexOptions.Compiled.

Another of the few differences between compiled and source-generated regexes had to do with backreferences. A case-sensitive backreference, such as the\1in([a-z]+)-\1, asks whether the next input equals text that was previously captured in the match. Source-generated regexes were using the optimizedSequenceEqualto do that comparison, whereasRegexOptions.Compiledwasn’t. Withdotnet/runtime#123914in .NET 11, now it does.

Searching isn’t limited toRegex, of course. Many other methods in .NET help finding things and comparing things, some of which get notable bumps in .NET 11.

TheAsciiclass provides optimized helpers for validating and manipulating ASCII text. Members likeEqualsare already vectorized in .NET 10, but in .NET 11,dotnet/runtime#123115improves that implementation by ensuring that inputs of length 8 through 15 can be vectorized, as well.

dotnet/runtime#130644also improves equality performance, in this case withSequenceEqualover a
span ofGuidorInt128. Previously,SequenceEqualtreated these as
arbitrary structures and compared them one element at a time. The PR teaches
the runtime that their fixed bitwise representations are suitable for
comparison as raw bytes. That enables the same optimized memory-comparison
path used for primitive types, including JIT unrolling and vectorization:

Another improvement in .NET 11 is tostring.Split.
Beforestring.Splitcan produce the resulting strings, it first needs to
find the characters that separate them and record their positions. In .NET 10, that search is
already vectorized: rather than examine one UTF-16 character at a time, it
loads a vector’s worth, compares all of its lanes against the separator in
parallel, and turns the comparison result into a mask identifying any matches.
It then advances to the next vector, or uses the mask to record the matching
positions. In .NET 11, on x86/x64,dotnet/runtime#125379from@hamarb123makes the no-match path cheaper
for ASCII separators. It loads two vectors of UTF-16 characters, packs their
16-bit elements into one vector of bytes, and checks that combined vector for
the separator. If there isn’t a match, it has skipped twice as much input with
one packed comparison; only a possible match requires the full 16-bit
comparisons needed to determine its exact position. (This same packing technique
is already employed elsewhere, such as in variousSearchValues<T>implementations.)

A related Arm64 text-search improvement comes fromdotnet/runtime#126678.
A vector comparison produces a vector whose elements are all zero for
non-matches and all one bits for matches. Finding the first or last match then
requires condensing those bits into a scalar value and counting its leading or
trailing zeros. On x86, the runtime can use a movemask instruction for that
condensing step. Arm64 has no direct equivalent, and the old implementation
needed a sequence of shifts, widening operations, and a horizontal add to achieve it.
The .NET 11 implementation now usesshrn, Arm64’s shift-right-and-narrow
instruction, to pack the relevant bits directly.SearchValues<char>uses these helpers, so the following benchmark reaches
the affected code while searching for a match at the end of the input.

// dotnet run -c Release -f net10.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net10.0 net11.0

using BenchmarkDotNet.Running;
using System.Buffers;

 private static readonly string s_input = new string('x', Length - 1) + 'e';

 [Benchmark]
 public int IndexOfAny() => s_input.AsSpan().IndexOfAny(s_vowels);
}

The .NET 10 match-index path requires this sequence:

; Arm64
; .NET 10
cmeq v16.16b, v16.16b, #0
movi v17.16b, #0x80
and v16.16b, v16.16b, v17.16b
ldr q17, [MASK]
ushl v16.16b, v16.16b, v17.16b
uxtl2 v17.8h, v16.16b
shl v17.8h, v17.8h, #8
uaddw v16.8h, v17.8h, v16.8b
addv h16, v16.8h
umov w2, v16.h[0]
mvn w2, w2
rbit w2, w2
clz w2, w2

In .NET 11, the equivalent work is simpler:

; Arm64
; .NET 11
cmeq v16.16b, v16.16b, #0
mvn v16.16b, v16.16b
shrn v16.8b, v16.8h, #4
fmov x2, d16
rbit x2, x2
clz x2, x2
lsr w2, w2, #2

MemoryExtensionsalready provides span-based searches for one or more values
withIndexOfAny, and for contiguous ranges withIndexOfAnyInRange, along
withExcept,Contains, and last-index variants of these operations. For
example,span.IndexOfAnyInRange('0', '9')finds the next ASCII digit.
Whitespace is also common to search for, but the characters recognized bychar.IsWhiteSpaceare spread across multiple parts of Unicode rather than
forming one contiguous range. To avoid requiring every caller to construct
the sameSearchValues<char>,dotnet/runtime#111439from@AlexRadchaddsContainsAnyWhiteSpace,IndexOfAnyWhiteSpace,IndexOfAnyExceptWhiteSpace,LastIndexOfAnyWhiteSpace, andLastIndexOfAnyExceptWhiteSpaceforReadOnlySpan<char>. Their sharedSearchValues<char>-based implementation vectorizes these searches for
parsers, validators, trimming code, and other text-processing code.

This is, however, a good example of how vectorization isn’t always a win. Take
trimming. To trim leading whitespace, code needs to find the first character
that isn’t whitespace. That character could be deep into the string, but in
the most common case, there’s little or nothing to trim. A scalar loop can
then return after inspecting just one or two characters, whereas the
vectorized helper has fixed setup cost. It’s still worth vectorizing, because
that overhead is small and the benefits when there is a lot to scan can be
significant. Something to keep in mind.

This method is a particularly good fit when needing to validate that input does not contain any whitespace; that requires searching the entirety of input, which is where the vectorization in these methods shines.

Closely related to searching is sorting. Years ago, sorting methods forSpan<T>were added toMemoryExtensions. Interestingly, the method wasn’t added asSort<T>but rather asSort<T, TComparer>whereTComparer : IComparer<T>. That signature enables a caller to provide a struct comparer without allocating a delegate or class-based comparer. Because the comparer is a constrained value type, the JIT should also be able to inline the comparison into the hot sorting loop. In practice, the implementation boxed the struct into anIComparer<T>, both allocating and turning every comparison back into an interface call. This was known at the time, but avoiding the box used generic implementation techniques that then carried too much runtime and code-size cost. Those supporting costs have since been addressed, sodotnet/runtime#116109from@2A5Fnow carries a value-type comparer throughSpan<T>.Sortwithout boxing it. The JIT can specialize the sorting routine for that comparer and inline the comparison.

The generic specialization does increase generated code and very large comparer structs can be more expensive to copy; this optimization is aimed at the small stateless or lightly stateful structs for which the API was designed.

## Collections and LINQ

Much of the collection and LINQ work in .NET 11 comes from taking better
advantage of information that’s already available. A collection often knows
much more than anIEnumerable<T>can express: its count, its contiguous
storage, its comparer, or the layout of its hash table. Similarly, a LINQ
iterator can know how many elements it represents or how its operations were
composed. Preserving that information can avoid enumeration, temporary
storage, repeated hashing, and other work a general-purpose implementation
would otherwise need to perform.

dotnet/runtime#119896from@prozolicchangesImmutableArray.Createto useArray.Copyrather than a hand-written element loop. A general element-by-element copy repeatedly performs indexing and assignment, while the runtime can specializeArray.Copyfor the element type and size. For blittable data, it can use optimized bulk memory copies, and for reference types, which need GC write barriers, it performs the required write barriers in the runtime’s tuned copy helpers. The change therefore both simplifies the managed code and givesImmutableArrayaccess to those optimized implementations.

Dictionary<TKey, TValue>.Removehad also missed an optimization already used by lookup and insertion.dotnet/runtime#125884gives value-type keys a streamlined loop for the common default-comparer case. Because that path doesn’t need a virtual comparer call, the JIT can keep more of the operation’s state in registers; reference-type keys and custom comparers continue to use the general path.

dotnet/runtime#128988from@prozolicremoves a second hash-table lookup when removing a matching key-value pair fromOrderedDictionary<TKey, TValue>throughICollection<KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue>>. That interface operation must first find the key and verify that its stored value equals the supplied value. Once both checks have succeeded, the implementation already has the entry index needed for removal. Looking up the key again unnecessarily repeats its hash computation and collision-chain walk, so the updated path removes the known entry directly.

dotnet/runtime#122952goes further when two hash tables have compatible layouts. Normally,UnionWithenumerates the source and inserts every element independently, recomputing hashes, checking for duplicates, and potentially resizing the destination along the way. If the destination is empty and both sets use compatible comparers, every source entry is already unique under exactly the equality rules the destination needs.UnionWithcan therefore use the existingHashSet<T>copy-constructor fast path to clone the populated storage rather than rebuilding the same table entry by entry.

dotnet/runtime#128300from@AndrewP-GHalso helps with collection construction. Building aFrozenDictionary<TKey, TValue>first requires collecting the input elements into a regularDictionary<TKey, TValue>if they’re not already in one. That temporary dictionary resolves duplicate keys before the final frozen representation is chosen, but in .NET 10 it was growing incrementally even when the source’s count was readily available. This PR uses that count as the
dictionary’s initial capacity, avoiding repeated allocation, copying, and
rehashing as it’s populated.

SetEqualsasks whether two sets contain the same values, regardless of insertion order. The general implementation needs a temporary mutable set so it can account for duplicates and arbitrary enumeration order. When the other input is already a hash set with a compatible comparer, though, that reconstruction is unnecessary.dotnet/runtime#126309from@aw0lidadds toImmutableHashSet<T>.SetEqualsdirect zero-allocation paths for compatibleImmutableHashSet<T>andHashSet<T>inputs; with an identical comparer, the sets can be considered equal if they have the same count and if every element from one is found in the other.

Sorted sets have a related case.SetEqualscan be passed anyIEnumerable<T>. That sequence might be unordered and might contain duplicate values, soImmutableSortedSet<T>previously copied it into a temporarySortedSet<T>before performing the comparison. However, when the input is another sorted set using the same ordering comparer, both sets contain unique values and enumerate those values
in the same order. Equality can then be determined by first comparing their
counts and, if those match, advancing both enumerators together. The first
unequal pair proves the sets are different, and reaching the end without finding
a difference proves they’re equal.dotnet/runtime#126549from@aw0lidrecognizes this case forImmutableSortedSet<T>, avoiding the temporarySortedSet<T>and comparing the two sorted sequences directly in one linear pass:

SortedSet<T>already enjoyed an optimization for that case in .NET 10, but it’s not left out of .NET 11 improvements.SortedSet<T>.GetViewBetweenreturns aSortedSet<T>view, effectively a slice of anotherSortedSet<T>, a live window onto a range of another set: changes through the view affect the original set. Clearing a view therefore can’t replace the view with an empty collection; it must find and remove every original node in that range.dotnet/runtime#126410from@prozolicreduces the temporary storage used for that operation. The implementation pre-sizes the list of elements to remove and walks it by index rather than repeatedly removing from and shrinking the temporary list.

Collections are frequently consumed through LINQ. Although its operators work
in terms of the generalIEnumerable<T>abstraction, LINQ’s internal
iterators can preserve useful facts about their sources and the operations
already applied. Those facts can sometimes answer a query without enumerating
the source at all.

For example, considersource.Append(x).Skip(10).LastOrDefault(). LINQ queries are lazy, so the actual search begins only whenLastOrDefaultasks theSkipiterator for its last element. Ifsource.Append(x)contains ten or fewer elements,Skip(10)necessarily removes all of them, leaving an empty sequence from
whichLastOrDefaultmust return the default value.Append,Prepend, andConcatiterators can cheaply report their total count when their underlying
sources can do so.dotnet/runtime#123306from@prozolicteaches the last-element path forSkipto compare that count with the number being skipped and immediately
report that there is no element, rather than searching a sequence it already
knows is empty.

.NET 11 also improve’s LINQ’sEnumerable.Sum.Sumalready uses SIMD. The
main loop processes four vectors at a time, alternating between two
accumulators so that the additions don’t require extra moves. However,Sumalso promises to throw if the result overflows. Alongside each vector addition,
the implementation uses the signs of the two inputs and the result to update
another vector that tracks whether any lane overflowed. After every
group of four vectors, the loop tests that tracking vector and branches to the
throwing path if needed. Overflow is rare, though, so on the common path that test and branch almost always just
confirm that nothing happened.dotnet/runtime#127429removes that repeated work in .NET 11. It accumulates the overflow information
across all of the vector processing and tests it once after the vector loops
have completed. The checked-overflow behavior remains the same, but the normal
path no longer needs to stop and check after every four vectors. The PR also
simplifies how the method walks the input, replacing unsafe reference and index
arithmetic with span-based vector loads, progressively slicing off the elements
already processed, and using aforeachfor the final scalar elements.

Since its inception, LINQ has hadJoinandGroupJoin, and .NET 10
introduced the long-requestedLeftJoinandRightJoin. In .NET 11,dotnet/runtime#127236addsFullJoin. The operators differ
in which unmatched elements they retain and how they represent the matches:

* Joinemits only pairs whose keys match.
* GroupJoinemits every left element together with a sequence containing its
matching right elements; that sequence is empty when there are no matches.
* LeftJoinemits the matching pairs and also unmatched left elements, paired
with a default value for the right.
* RightJoindoes the inverse, emitting the matching pairs and also unmatched right elements, paired with a default value for the left.
* FullJoinemits the matching pairs and the unmatched elements from both
inputs, using a default value for whichever side is missing.

Before .NET 11, applications typically approximated it by combiningGroupJoin,SelectMany, andConcat, then searching the first input again
to find right-side elements without a match. The built-in operator avoids both
that composition of iterators and the repeated search.

The earlierSkipexample showed how many LINQ optimizations come from one operator flowing information to subsequent operators that can then be used for additional optimization. This is typically done by adding that additional information to properties on the concrete internalIEnumerable<T>implementations used bySystem.Linq. SynchronousEnumerablehas accumulated many such specialized iterators over many releases, focusing in particular on places where algorithmic complexity could be significantly reduced.AsyncEnumerable, introduced “in the box” in .NET 10, initially had much less of that machinery; for asynchronous sequences dominated by I/O, it often wouldn’t matter.

Concatenation is an important exception. Prior to .NET 11, every call toAsyncEnumerable.Appendcreated a new iterator around the sequence produced
by the previous call. Consider a chain with just three appended values:

var sequence = AsyncEnumerable.Empty<int>()
 .Append(0)
 .Append(1)
 .Append(2);

To produce0, enumeration needs to pass through all three nested iterators.
Producing1passes through two, and producing2passes through one. Thus,
yielding three values involves roughly3 + 2 + 1iterator steps. With 1,000
appends, that grows to1,000 + 999 + ... + 1, or approximately 500,000
steps, rather than approximately 1,000. In general, enumerating N values
requires O(N^2) work. Several years backEnumerableaddressed this by special-casing the various concatenation enumerables to flow enough information through to make iterating the chain O(N) rather than O(N^2), and in .NET 11,dotnet/runtime#122389applies that toAsyncEnumerableas well. The operators accumulate the extra elements or sequences in one flat representation instead of adding another wrapper for each LINQ operator.

## I/O

I/O performance is often equated with the speed of the underlying device, but
the transfer itself is only one part of an operation. A cached file read may
complete in microseconds, many redirected pipes may be active concurrently,
and compression may operate entirely on data already in memory. In cases like
these, the managed overhead around the operation can be as important as the
time spent moving the data.

That overhead includes setting up the appropriate synchronous or asynchronous
OS mechanism, keeping state alive until an operation completes,
allocating and copying temporary buffers, and adapting between the caller’s
data and stream-based APIs. .NET 11 removes work from each of these layers.

On Windows, “overlapped I/O” is the asynchronous model in which an operation begins now and the operating system posts its completion later. Any time .NET performs I/O as part of an asynchronous operation on Windows, it strives to use a corresponding overlapped I/O API rather than using a synchronous API asynchronously (i.e. queuing a work item that blocks a thread pool thread doing the I/O). However, there have been some stragglers. Redirected child-process output previously used synchronous pipe handles, soReadToEndAsyncon the stream from aProcess‘s stdout or stderrStreamstill needed a thread-pool thread blocked in a native read for each stdout or stderr pipe. In .NET 11,dotnet/runtime#125643instead opens the parent’s stdout and stderr ends for overlapped reads, while leaving the child ends synchronous (as console applications expect).

We often refer to the mechanism being fixed as “async over sync.” The opposite
case, “sync over async,” can be even worse, as it means blocking one thread
while waiting for another to do some work; that provides one of the necessary
ingredients for cycles and deadlocks, and is a leading cause of scalability
bottlenecks in services, so we try to stamp out “sync over async” whenever
possible. In cases where we can’t avoid it, though, we can at least make it
better.

RandomAccess.Readprovides one such opportunity when it’s used with a
Windows file handle opened for asynchronous I/O. Windows requires specifying at the time of file opening whether I/O will be overlapped or not, and if it is, Windows still requires a read to use itsOVERLAPPEDmechanism, even in a synchronousReadcase where the API’s caller is going to block until that read completes. While we can’t avoid that overlapped I/O, we can still make the operation cheaper. Previously, .NET both gave the operation an event for the calling thread to wait on and registered an I/O-completion callback. Instead,dotnet/runtime#126845uses a
documented Windows convention: setting the low bit ofOVERLAPPED.hEventinstructs Windows to signal the event when the operation completes but not to
also queue a completion packet to the I/O completion port. The calling thread
can wait on an event cached by the file handle, retrieve the result, and
perform the cleanup itself. This removes the callback, its coordination, and
the per-operation allocation while still performing the same synchronous
wait.

Archive and file APIs remove similar temporary allocations. A GNU tar header
has fixed-size fields for an entry’s name and link target. When either doesn’t
fit,TarWriteremits an additional metadata record containing the long
value. In .NET 10,TarWriterfirst encoded that value into a newly allocated
byte array, then wrote the bytes and a null terminator into a newMemoryStream. Because the stream didn’t know the final size, it allocated
and grew its own backing array as the data was written. Withdotnet/runtime#123835, .NET 11
instead computes the exact UTF-8 size including the terminator, allocates one
array of that size, encodes directly into it, and constructs theMemoryStreamover that array. This removes both the temporary encoded array
and the stream’s growth and copying.

ZipArchivesimilarly eliminates temporary buffers. ZIP archives end with a
central directory describing their entries. Reading that directory allocated
a new 4 KB buffer for everyZipArchive, along with additional arrays in a
few paths that needed to combine or slice data. Withdotnet/runtime#123836, .NET 11
now rents the central-directory buffer fromArrayPool<byte>and uses spans

.NET provides great high-level abstractions for working with all manner of
data and I/O. One of the most prominent isStream, which provides a simple,
flexible mechanism for reading and writing many different data sources and
formats:MemoryStream,FileStream,CryptoStream,ZLibStream,SslStream, and on and on. For folks that really care about maximizing
performance, however, sometimes you want to go a bit lower-level and deal
directly with the underlying primitives. For example, the various compression
streams,ZLibStream,DeflateStream,GZipStream, andBrotliStream, all
maintain buffers that hold input and output data waiting to be read or written.
But what if the caller already owns its input and output buffers, or wants to
use a pool for them? In .NET 11,dotnet/runtime#123145exposes
the underlyingDeflateEncoder/DeflateDecoder,ZLibEncoder/ZLibDecoder, andGZipEncoder/GZipDecodertypes, following
the existingBrotliEncoderandBrotliDecoderpattern. The stream types are wrappers around these encoders and decoders, and in
.NET 11 you can now use them directly. They support chunkedCompress,Decompress, andFlushoperations as well as one-shotTryCompressandTryDecompress, enabling callers to supply and reuse their own buffers rather
than going through adapter streams and their buffers.

## Networking

Networking is the bread-and-butter of many applications and sits directly on the hot path of scalable services. Improvements throughout the stack add up quickly.

At the bottom of the stack, connections and sockets establish and carry the
byte stream. A socket doesn’t actually connect to a host name; it connects to
an IP address and port. Resolving a host name may produce multiple candidate
addresses, including one or more IPv4 addresses from DNS A records and one or
more IPv6 addresses from AAAA records. WhenSocketAsyncEventArgs.RemoteEndPointis aDnsEndPoint, the existingSocket.ConnectAsyncimplementation performs that resolution and tries the resulting addresses in sequence. It starts a connection to the first address, and only if that attempt fails does it move on to the next. This works well when the first address is reachable. A failed TCP connection isn’t always reported quickly, however. If packets sent over that route are simply dropped, the attempt may remain pending until a timeout even though another address for the same host could have connected immediately.

This problem is especially visible on machines with both IPv4 and IPv6.
Clients generally want to prefer IPv6 when it works, but a broken or
misconfigured IPv6 path can make an application wait through a long
timeout before trying IPv4. The technique commonly known asHappy Eyeballsaddresses this by
overlapping connection attempts. Rather than putting all the latency of one
candidate in front of the next, it starts another attempt after a short delay
and uses the first connection that succeeds. The remaining attempts are then
canceled or discarded. That consumes some additional resources, but it can
greatly reduce the long tail of connection establishment.

In .NET 11,dotnet/runtime#106374adds an opt-in, Happy-Eyeballs-like strategy to the staticSocket.ConnectAsyncoverload that accepts aSocketAsyncEventArgs. The new overload accepts
aConnectAlgorithm, whereConnectAlgorithm.Defaultpreserves the existing
sequential behavior, whileConnectAlgorithm.Parallelrequests the new
strategy. When parallel connection is requested for an address-family-unspecifiedDnsEndPointon a machine that supports both IPv4 and IPv6, .NET starts
separate IPv4 and IPv6 DNS queries and runs a connection loop for each family
concurrently. Addresses within each family are still tried sequentially, but
the two families no longer wait on each other. The first successful connection
becomes theConnectSocket, and a connection subsequently established by the
other family is disposed. If one family fails, the other is allowed to
continue; the operation reports failure only after neither can connect.
Parallel mode can briefly establish two connections, while the default remains
cheaper when the first candidate connects promptly.

Given the nature of the change, it’s a little hard to create a real benchmark
for this, but we can get creative. Here I’ve created IPv4
and IPv6 listeners on the same port, but arranged the benchmark to only accept
from the IPv4 listener. On my machine,localhostresolves to::1before127.0.0.1, so the client sockets by default would first try the IPv6 address
and only when it fails try the IPv4 one. The benchmark setup fills the IPv6
listener’s accept backlog, such that additional client connect requests will
stall.

A bit synthetic, but it conveys the idea.

Another interesting improvement around sockets has to do withSocket.Blocking. “Berkeley sockets”, which is what all modern stacks implement, implement the notion of blocking / non-blocking modes. Typically by default, as is the case with .NET, sockets are in blocking mode. That means, for example, arecv()/Socket.Receiveoperation will synchronously block until data is available (or the socket closes). The other option is non-blocking; a socket in non-blocking mode will always return immediately from arecvoperation, regardless of whether there’s data to read or not. If the operation would have blocked in blocking mode, in non-blocking mode it’ll instead return an error code, EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK, which the consuming application can then use to, for example, decide to try again later.

Enter .NET asynchronous operations. On Windows, the Windows sockets APIs provided overlapped APIs that the .NETSocketAPIs can and do employ. But on Unix, we have the standardrecvand friends functions. We also have mechanisms likeepoll(Linux) andkqueue(macOS) that let us efficiently and synchronously wait for large numbers of file descriptors to have some activity. As such, on Unix, .NET implements asynchronous socket operations by putting aSocketinto a non-blocking state, trying the synchronous operation (e.g.recvfor aSocket.ReceiveAsync), and then if the operation couldn’t complete yet and we get back an EAGAIN/EWOULDBLOCK, data about the operation gets queued intoepoll/kqueue-based machinery that will signal when the operation should be retried. This is very similar conceptually to how overlapped I/O works on Windows with I/O completion ports.

Now here’s the rub. To implement asynchronous operations on sockets, we need to flip the socket into non-blocking mode… what do we then do if, say, someone doesSocket.ReceiveAsyncbut then follows that up withSocket.Send. The socket was flipped into non-blocking mode for the first operation… do we flip it back for the second? It turns out that’s really risky to do, with race conditions making it hard and expensive to get right due to multi-threaded use (expensive because we’d need extra synchronization). When first bringing up .NET on Linux, we made the decision that the flip would be a one-way trip: once non-blocking, always non-blocking. We flip the first time an asynchronous operation is performed, and we leave it there.

What, then, do we do if someone does in fact issue a synchronousReceive/Sendafter it’s already been flipped? We simulate the blocking ourselves with sync over async, basically doing the asynchronous operation and blocking on it to complete. Internally we’re able to do it cheaper than actually creating a task and blocking on it, but as a mechanism it’s basically the same.

We were comfortable with this approach in the early days on the theory that if someone starts using asynchronous operations, they’re likely to continue to, and for the odd synchronous operation here and there after that, it’s not a big deal. That has largely proven out over the many years since… except for one case.

Turns out in some systems it’s reasonably common for the initial connect to be asynchronous but then followed only by synchronous sends and receives. This ends up paying that overhead on all operations: you doConnectAsync, we flip the socket to be non-blocking, and then everyReceive/Sendafter that ends up paying the emulation costs. But there’s good news. It turns out this is also a case where we can easily and safely flip back: we can flip back to blocking before handing back control fromConnectAsync. For the staticConnectAsyncoverloads, the caller won’t even have a reference to the connectedSocketuntilConnectAsyncgives it to them, and for the instance overloads, it’s defined to be erroneous to use such send/receive operations on theSocketconcurrent withConnectAsync. As such, in all cases, we can just flip it back to blocking before completing the task representing the operation. That’s exactly whatdotnet/runtime#124200does now in .NET 11.

The background socket echoes each byte. When the client callsReceivebefore the reply is available, .NET 10 must emulate the wait with the Unix
socket poller, whereas .NET 11 can wait in the native blockingrecvcall.

Windows has a different concern around its asynchronous socket operations.
I mentioned that Windows supplies functions that utilize overlapped I/O. These APIs, e.g.AcceptEx,ConnectEx,DisconnectEx, andWSARecvMsg, are
extension functions supplied by the installed Winsock provider. .NET looks up
their function pointers dynamically and caches them based on the socket’s
address family, socket type, and protocol. EachSocketinstance consults that cache the first time it needs one of these functions. In .NET 10, that cache was a small globalList<T>guarded by a lock. The list rarely contains more than a handful of entries and almost every lookup finds an entry that was initialized earlier, but even those read-only hits acquired the same lock. When many sockets began their first asynchronous operation concurrently, all of those lookups were forced through the lock one at a time.dotnet/runtime#124997changes
the cache to a copy-on-write array. The common read path takes a snapshot of
the array and scans it without locking. A miss still acquires a lock,
double-checks the latest array, and publishes a new array containing the
additional entry. Because entries are added only when a new combination of
address family, socket type, and protocol is encountered, misses are rare and
the warmed path no longer serializes.

Once you have the socket connection, often the next step is to layer in TLS,
withSslStream. During client-certificate negotiation, a server can include
in itsCertificateRequestmessage the distinguished names of certificate
authorities whose certificates it will accept.SslStreamturns each encoded
X.500 name into anX500DistinguishedName, ultimately making the names
available to certificate-selection logic. In .NET 10, that involved allocating
abyte[]for every name. On Windows, the implementation created a span over
the native SSPI buffer and then calledToArray; on macOS, it copied each
Core FoundationCFDatavalue into a new managed array.
TheX500DistinguishedName(ReadOnlySpan<byte>)constructor has existed since
.NET 5, but both of theseSslStreampaths predated it and weren’t updated
when it was added. Withdotnet/runtime#123904, .NET 11
removes those intermediate arrays. Both implementations instead pass aReadOnlySpan<byte>over the native encoding directly to theX500DistinguishedNameconstructor. The macOS implementation keeps theCFDatahandle alive while that span is in use, but the per-authority managed
copy is no longer needed.

Once a client certificate has been selected, macOS requiresSslStreamto
package the native handles for the leaf certificate and its intermediate
certificates into a Core Foundation array. In .NET 10,SslStreamfirst
allocated anIntPtr[]large enough for the entire chain, populated it with
those handles, and then used the array to create the nativeCFArray.dotnet/runtime#123905in .NET 11 changes the interop layer to accept aReadOnlySpan<IntPtr>instead.SslStreambuilds the handle list in aSpan<IntPtr>, usingstackallocfor
chains of up to 128 certificates and falling back to a managed array only for
larger chains. Typical certificate chains are far smaller than that, so the
usual setup path no longer allocates the temporaryIntPtr[]at all.

A larger Linux change removes copies from the steady-state encrypted-data
path.SslStreamuses OpenSSL, and OpenSSL traditionally exchanges data with
its caller through in-memory buffers known as BIOs. In .NET 10, encryption
first wrote ciphertext into an OpenSSL memory BIO, after which .NET copied it
into the buffer to send. Decryption went in the other direction: .NET copied
received ciphertext into a memory BIO, and after OpenSSL decrypted it,SslStreamcopied the plaintext from its own buffer into the caller’s buffer.

dotnet/runtime#128245replaces
those memory BIOs with a custom BIO that can point directly at managed buffers.
In .NET 11, OpenSSL can write encrypted output directly into the bufferSslStreamwill send and, in the common case, write decrypted plaintext
directly into the buffer supplied by the caller. The change also combines the
setup, OpenSSL operation, and cleanup into one native call rather than four.
OpenSSL still performs its own internal TLS processing, andSslStreamretains
a fallback buffer for unusual cases such as TLS alerts or output that doesn’t
fit, but the normal application-data path avoids the extra staging copies.

The following benchmark provides a way to reproduce the impact using
only public APIs. It establishes a TLS 1.3 connection once, outside the
measurement, and then sends one 16-KB TLS record in each direction:

Moving up the stack,HttpClient‘s core HTTP implementation inSocketsHttpHandlerlayers protocol processing on top of TLS and the
underlying sockets. WithAutomaticDecompressionenabled,SocketsHttpHandleradvertises
supported encodings on the request, checks the response’s finalContent-Encoding, and, when it recognizes gzip, deflate, or Brotli, presents
anHttpContentwhose stream decodes the compressed transport bytes as the
caller reads them.dotnet/runtime#122676precomputes the combinedAccept-Encodingvalue when the handler is created. In the common case where the caller hasn’t supplied that header, it adds the combined value directly, avoiding anHttpHeaderValueCollection, its backing list and header-storage object, and an enumeration of the collection for each enabled algorithm. On the response side,TryGetValuesavoids materializing a collection when there is noContent-Encoding. When decompression is needed, the wrapper takes ownership of the original content-header collection, removes the now-invalidContent-Lengthand the encoding it consumes, and retains any preceding encodings without copying every header into a new collection.

SocketsHttpHandlersaw other improvements. HTTP content often consists of a single value, but sometimes a request or response needs to carry several independent pieces together in one body. Multipart content provides that packaging. For example, an HTML form submission might contain a few text fields and a file; each becomes a separate part with its own headers and content, while the collection of parts is sent as one HTTP message body. The receiver needs to know where one part ends and the next begins, so the
message uses a boundary: a token chosen to be unlikely to occur in the content
itself. In .NET 10,MultipartContentretained the boundary as a string. Each time the content was
serialized, it rebuilt the opening and closing delimiter strings, encoded them
into bytes, and separately wrote the pieces of the delimiters between parts.
In .NET 11,dotnet/runtime#124963instead constructs and
encodes the opening and closing delimiters once, when theMultipartContentis
created. The serialization
paths can then reuse and directly write those cached bytes.

Several allocation reductions remove collections created only to populate or inspect another collection. For example,dotnet/runtime#122677writes HTTP/3 trailers directly into the finalHttpResponseHeaderscollection, eliminating a temporaryListof tuples. Trailers are headers sent after the response body, commonly carrying information such as checksums that isn’t known when the initial headers are written.

Other paths only need a transient view over existing storage.dotnet/runtime#131142hasSocketsHttpHandlerinspect available HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 connections through
spans, avoiding a copy of each list to an array during idle-connection
eviction.dotnet/runtime#123034similarly changesHeaderUtilities.DumpHeaders, which is used as part ofToStringon header collections, to take aparams ReadOnlySpan<HttpHeaders?>, removing a small array allocation fromHttpRequestMessage.ToString()andHttpResponseMessage.ToString().

Improvements in .NET 11 also show up forUri. Considerhttps://user@example.com:8443/files/report%20Q3?q=%E4%BD%A0%E5%A5%BD#summary.
BeforeUrican exposeScheme,UserInfo,Host,Port,AbsolutePath,Query, andFragment, it first locates delimiters such as:,/,@,?, and#. It then validates each delimited component. ASCII can usually
remain as-is,%20needs unescaping or preservation according to the
component, and the percent-encoded UTF-8 in the query needs decoding and
Unicode-aware canonicalization. Withdotnet/runtime#124433, .NET 11 usesIndexOfAnyandSearchValuesfor more of the delimiter-finding work, examining long spans a vector at a time rather than character by character. And once the component boundaries are known,dotnet/runtime#119435replaces repeated reserved-character and unsafe-character tests with a single optimizedSearchValueslookup.

After finding a component,Urichecks whether its text is already in
canonical form or needs to be escaped or normalized. Letters and digits are
by far the most common characters, but in .NET 10 they still flowed through
the more general character tests. Some callers could also repeat a
canonicalization check whose answer parsing had already established.dotnet/runtime#121270adds a
fast path for ASCII letters and digits and records the earlier result so that
.NET 11 can avoid performing the same check again.

Non-ASCII input can require several parts of a URI to be normalized. For
example, Unicode characters may need to be preserved or percent-encoded
differently depending on whether they occur in the path, query, or fragment.
In .NET 10, parsing and rebuilding were interleaved:Urinormalized each of
those components separately and repeatedly extended its stored string as it
went. In addition to making the offset bookkeeping complicated, those
individual normalization results and string concatenations could create
roughly five temporary strings. In .NET 11,dotnet/runtime#122038separates
that rebuilding work from the subsequent validation.Urinormalizes the path, query, and fragment into one builder, creates the final
string once, and then validates the component boundaries in that completed
string. The host is still handled separately, but the remaining components no
longer each produce intermediate strings.

## JSON

JSON readers and writers spend much of their time scanning text: writers look
for characters that need escaping, while readers look for whitespace and token
boundaries. .NET 11 makes several of those scans more efficient.

When using the default encoder,Utf8JsonWriterneeds to locate characters
such as quotation marks and control characters that can’t be copied directly
into JSON. In .NET 10, that search was routed throughJavaScriptEncoder.Default.dotnet/runtime#129781instead gives .NET 11 precomputedSearchValuessets for the default escaping
rules, allowing the writer to search the input directly. Once it finds a character to escape, the writer must emit a sequence such as\"or\u0022. In .NET 10, the escaping helper received the entire
remaining destination and performed repeated bounds checks as it wrote each
byte or character.dotnet/runtime#129803passes only the range known to be writable. The JIT can then prove once that
the escape fits and remove the checks from the individual stores.

On the reading side, insignificant whitespace is allowed between JSON tokens.

## Diagnostics

Creating anActivity, polling metrics, and logging all add overhead beyond what
the application is otherwise trying to accomplish. That cost is deliberately
paid to make production systems understandable, but observability code also
sits on paths that can execute for every request, dependency call, or log
event. Small fixed costs there can really add up, and disabled or
unobserved instrumentation needs to be “pay for play” so applications don’t
incur meaningful costs for diagnostics they aren’t currently collecting.

Let’s start with distributed tracing. A trace follows a request as it travels
through an application and potentially across multiple services. Each
operation along the way can be represented by anActivity; the activities
have their own span IDs, but share a trace ID that lets a tracing system
correlate them as parts of the same request. The W3C Trace Context standard
defines how those identifiers are carried between services, including in an
HTTPtraceparentheader. Its trace ID is represented as 32 lowercase
hexadecimal characters, and it can’t be all zeroes. Applications may need to parse and validate that identifier for every request.
In .NET 10,DiagnosticSourcedid so with a loop that checked each character
both for whether it was hexadecimal and whether it was non-zero.
In .NET 11,dotnet/runtime#119673replaces
that loop with twoContainsAnyExceptsearches: one detects a character
outside0–9anda–f, while the other determines whether the entire ID
is zeroes. Those searches can examine multiple characters at a time.W3CPropagatorhad similar hand-written loops for validating trace-state and
baggage characters. In addition to replacing those loops withSearchValues<char>, the same PR changes baggage encoding to search for the
first character that requires escaping. If there isn’t one, as is common, it
can append the whole value at once rather than checking and appending every
character individually.

Process APIs present a different kind of diagnostics overhead. Launching a
process requires translating managed arguments and environment variables into
the representation expected by the operating system, while inspection often
crosses into native APIs to retrieve only a small piece of information.

At the lowest level, a new process on Unix receives its command-line arguments
and environment asargvandenvp. Each is a null-terminated array of
pointers to null-terminated strings; the entries inargvare the executable
and its arguments, while each entry inenvphas the formkey=value.ProcessStartInfo, however, exposes managed strings and a managed environment
dictionary, soProcess.Startneeds to marshal all of that data into the
native representation. In .NET 10, buildingenvpfirst concatenated every key and value into a new managedkey=valuestring and collected those strings into an intermediate array. Bothargvandenvpwere then constructed with a native allocation for the pointer array and another allocation for each UTF-8 string. Withdotnet/runtime#126201, .NET 11
instead makes one pass to count the pointers and calculate the total number of
UTF-8 bytes required. It then allocates one native block forargvand one forenvp, with each block containing both its pointer table and all of its string
data, and writes the data directly into those blocks. That avoids the
intermediate managed strings and array, as well as all of the per-string native
allocations and frees.

There’s then the question of how the operating system actually creates the
process. The traditional Unix model usesforkto create a child that is
initially a logical copy of the parent, followed byexecin the child to
replace that copy with the requested executable. Copy-on-write meansforkdoesn’t immediately copy all of the parent’s memory, but the operating system
still needs to duplicate process state and page tables, work that can become
significant for a large, multithreaded application. In .NET 10,Process.Startused thisfork-then-execpath on macOS. Withdotnet/runtime#126063, .NET 11
usesposix_spawnfor the common case.posix_spawnasks the operating system
to create the new process and load its executable as one operation, while
still describing the required standard-input/output/error redirection, working
directory, and signal state. A launch that requests different user or group
credentials still usesforkandexec, as macOS’sposix_spawnfacilities
can’t perform the requiredsetuidandsetgidoperations.

Process creation dominates the elapsed time in this benchmark, but the
environment-marshalling allocation reduction is clear.

Once a process is running, aProcessinstance can expose a bunch of information about it. Much of that OS data is gathered and cached together
in an internalProcessInfoobject so that properties needing it can share the work. In .NET 10 on Linux and macOS, however, asking only forProcessNametriggered the machinery to populate the whole object and everything on it, which was unnecessarily costly if you only needed the name.Process.ToString()includes the process name, so it incurred the same cost. In .NET 11,dotnet/runtime#126449from@tmdsadds a narrower operating-system query for the
name.ProcessNameandToString()can use that to query without
collecting the rest of the process metadata.

Processcan also query processes on another Windows machine. APIs such asGetProcesses(string machineName)accept a machine name, and the remote path
uses Windows performance-counter infrastructure to retrieve the information.
That support in turn depends on additional components, including remote
Registry access. None of that should be necessary for an application that only
starts or inspects processes on its own machine. In .NET 10, however, several local-only APIs delegated to overloads that also supported remote machines. For example,GetProcessById(int)called the machine-name overload with".", and other helpers selected between local and remote implementations at run time. Even when the application always took the local branch, the trimmer saw a call path to both implementations and needed to preserve the remote-process andPerformanceCountercode. As a result, even a Native AOT application that did little more than callProcess.Startcould carry that unused support in its executable. In .NET 11,dotnet/runtime#126338gives
the local APIs dedicated paths that don’t reference the remote implementation.
The remote implementation is instead reached through a delegate initialized
only when an API is actually asked to operate on another machine. Remote
process inspection continues to work, but if an application uses only local
process APIs, .NET 11’s trimmer can now prove that the remote machinery and its
dependencies are unreachable and remove them, resulting in significantly smaller binary size.

// Add to the csproj's PropertyGroup:
// <PublishAot>true</PublishAot>

using System.Diagnostics;

using Process process = Process.Start(new ProcessStartInfo("cmd.exe", "/c exit")
{
 UseShellExecute = false
})!;
process.WaitForExit();

You can then publish both targets and inspect the resulting executable:

Metrics report numerical information about an application, such as the number
of requests processed or the current depth of a queue. WithSystem.Diagnostics.Metrics, aMetercreates instruments that produce those
measurements, and a listener such as an OpenTelemetry provider consumes them.
Some instruments are updated by the application whenever an event occurs. An
observable instrument instead registers a callback that computes its current
value when a listener asks to collect it. That pull model is useful for values
like queue depth: the application doesn’t need to record every change, only to
report the depth when it’s observed. The callback for anObservableGauge<T>,ObservableCounter<T>, orObservableUpDownCounter<T>can return aT, aMeasurement<T>, or anIEnumerable<Measurement<T>>. AMeasurement<T>pairs the value with any
associated tags, and the enumerable form allows one callback to report
multiple tagged values. The first two forms always produce exactly one
measurement. In .NET 10,ObservableInstrument<T>nevertheless normalized those
single-value forms into the enumerable model. Every time a listener collected
the instrument, it invoked the callback, put the result into a new one-elementMeasurement<T>[], and then enumerated that array to report the value. Withdotnet/runtime#128039from@unsafePtr, .NET 11 recognizes the built-in
single-value forms and sends their result directly toMeterListener.NotifyMeasurement, avoiding both the array and its enumeration.
The enumerable form retains its existing path: the application owns that
sequence, and it may legitimately contain any number of measurements.

In previous iterations of Performance Improvements in .NET, I’ve discussed
“false sharing.” Modern processors move data between memory and their caches
in fixed-size chunks known as cache lines, commonly 64 bytes. Before a core can
write to a location, it needs exclusive ownership of the cache line containing
that location, invalidating copies of the same line held by other cores. That matters even when the cores aren’t updating the same value. Imagine twolongfields next to each other in memory, with one core repeatedly updating
the first and another core repeatedly updating the second. The fields are
logically independent, but if they occupy the same cache line, each core’s
write invalidates the line for the other. Ownership of the line continually
bounces between the cores, limiting scalability despite there being no
sharing conceptually. Hence, “false sharing.”System.Runtime.Caching.MemoryCachemaintains performance counters for
operations such as gets, hits, misses, adds, removes, and trims. In .NET 10,
those counters were stored as elements in a smalllong[]. The array header,
including its length, and several unrelated counters could all occupy the same
cache line. Under load, cores performing different cache operations would
therefore contend for ownership of that line as they updated different
counters. Accessing a counter through the array also meant loading the array
length for a bounds check.dotnet/runtime#131470addresses this in .NET 11 by
replacing the array with named fields and laying those fields out across separate
cache lines. Counters that an operation naturally updates together can remain
together, while unrelated counters are kept apart. That deliberately spends a
small amount of additional memory on padding in order to reduce cache-line
bouncing under contention, while the named fields also avoid the array bounds
checks.

Logging is another per-event diagnostics path.
Microsoft.Extensions.Logging’s EventSource provider shrank its cost when theJsonMessagekeyword is on.dotnet/runtime#131229reuses a[ThreadStatic]MemoryStreamandUtf8JsonWriterinEventSourceLogger.ToJson, avoiding both allocations on every logged event,
leaving primarily the returned JSON string. Buffers larger than 1 KB aren’t

## Cryptography

ASN.1 is the binary data-description format used by
certificates, public and private keys, and many other cryptographic structures.
Its encodings are nested: reading a sequence produces another reader over the
sequence’s contents, which may itself contain more sequences.dotnet/runtime#125254addsValueAsnReader, a span-basedref structcounterpart toAsnReader.dotnet/runtime#125346further applies that representation to
selected RSA, PKCS/CMS, ECC, and X.509 decoders.
Anddotnet/runtime#125528carries it through generated
key loaders so parsing layers can pass views of the original data by reference
rather than wrapping the same bytes in new reader objects.

Some ASN.1 values add text validation to that parsing work. ASN.1 defines
several text types with restricted character sets.IA5Stringis ASCII, whileVisibleStringpermits the printable ASCII characters from space through~.
Encoding or decoding one must both copy the data and reject characters outside
the allowed range.dotnet/runtime#131109vectorizes that validation and
transcoding forIA5StringandVisibleString, checking and copying multiple
characters at once.dotnet/runtime#131170then applies the same approach
to big-endian UCS-2BMPString.

dotnet/runtime#131616takes that further and extends the approach to the non-contiguous character sets ofPrintableStringandNumericString. The validation has more than one accepted range, but it can still classify a vector of characters at a time and fall back to the scalar checks only where necessary:

Once all input is available, hashing needn’t retain reusable state. SHA-1 is no
longer suitable for security decisions such as signing new content, but .NET
still needs it for compatibility identifiers such as an assembly’s public-key
token.dotnet/runtime#120674adds a one-shot path to the internal implementation used for those non-secret
purposes. Its hash state, work area, and padding buffer can live on the stack.AssemblyName.GetPublicKeyToken()now uses the one-shot path as it has
the complete public key available for a single operation:

AES key wrap is used to encrypt cryptographic keys before they’re stored or
sent elsewhere. Wrapping or unwrapping one key requires applying AES many
times. In .NET 10 on Windows and Apple platforms, the implementation performed
each of those steps through a general-purpose helper that created a native AES
cipher, processed one block, and then destroyed the cipher. The publicAesobject could be reused, but internally a single key-wrap operation still
repeated that native setup and cleanup, with the number of repetitions growing
with the size of the key material.dotnet/runtime#129921from@vcsjoneschanges the Windows implementation to
create one native cipher and reuse it for the entire wrap or unwrap operation.dotnet/runtime#129911does the same for Apple’s
implementation.

Certificate validation can be dominated by work outside the signature math.
For example, during revocation checking on Linux, a downloaded certificate
revocation list (CRL) is persisted to disk. A later chain build could therefore
avoid the network, but it still needed to open the file, read it, parse the
encoded CRL, and create a new native handle.
For .NET 11,dotnet/runtime#123562adds a
bounded in-memory cache of parsed CRLs. A repeated lookup can reuse the native
CRL handle directly, while least-recently-used eviction and GC-assisted aging
prevent the cache from retaining entries indefinitely.

Authority Information Access (AIA) presents a related problem. A certificate
can name a URL from which a missing issuer certificate may be downloaded, and
multiple concurrent chain builds may all discover the same missing issuer.dotnet/runtime#130456reuses
the cache infrastructure so those builds share one asynchronous download
rather than issuing duplicate requests. Failed downloads aren’t cached, old
successful responses are refreshed in the background, and Linux now limits
each chain build to two AIA downloads, matching Windows and bounding the amount
of network work one chain can trigger.

## What’s Next?

Whew! Several hundred performance improvements later, .NET 11 is indeed one
louder. If any of the examples in this post look
like code in your applications, please try the latest.NET 11 release candidateand measure your own workloads. If something got faster, we’d love to hear about it. If something got slower, we’d also love to hear about it. And if you have ideas for how .NET 12 can be turned up even louder, we’re all ears.

Happy coding!
