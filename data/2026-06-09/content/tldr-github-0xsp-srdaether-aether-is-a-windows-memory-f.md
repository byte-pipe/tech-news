# Aether

version : 0.8 (public beta)

Aetheris a Windows memory-forensics and threat hunting tool that scans live process
memory for malicious pattern, detect injection techniques, implant signatures, reflectively loaded
.NET assemblies. it works with a multi-layer confidence model that dramatically reduce the false
positive rate and hunt for malicious behaviour. Aether has good capabilities in detecting Hollowing, APC, thread hijacking techniques. Security analysts can use it to scan,hunt and snapshot suspicious region for offline analysis.

## Core Features

quick explainations for Aether core features, you can read the full technical blogpost to get more insights:

### Signature Scanning

* Byte-pattern matchingacross process memory with afirst-byte indexthat provides 50-100x speedup over naive scanning
* ASCII + UTF-16LE dual encoding— catches strings stored by the .NET CLR
(where"msxsl:script"becomes6D 00 73 00 78 00 ...)
* Dynamic rule loadingfrom JSON files — drop new signatures intorules/without recompilation
* PE header detectioninMEM_PRIVATEregions — flags reflectively loaded
.NET assemblies (MZ+PE+BSJBmetadata)

### Structural Memory IOCs

Aether layersfive filterson top of the raw
working-set signal so a finding requires multiple agreeing indicators
before it is reported with FP filtering:

Layer

Filter

Purpose

L1

Structural

Only 
executable
 IMAGE sub-regions are considered (eliminates 
.data
 / 
.rdata
 COW noise)

L2

Quantitative

Grade by 
private_pages
 count and 
private_ratio
 (low / medium / high)

L3

Corroboration

Promote only if an 
independent
 signal agrees on the same allocation base — signature hit, 
missing_peb_entry
, 
private_rwx
, hook prologue, or on-disk diff

L4

CLR-aware

Per-module suppression for ngen / R2R / tiered-JIT targets (
*.ni.dll
, 
mscor*
, 
clr*
, 
coreclr
, 
system.private.corelib*
) instead of blanket-skipping when the CLR is loaded

L5

On-disk diff

Map the module file with 
CreateFileMappingW(SEC_IMAGE_NO_EXECUTE)
; compare the first 16 bytes of each private executable page against the same RVA on disk. Any divergence is a real-modification IOC

Other structural checks:

* PEB module cross-reference:MEM_IMAGEallocations that are not in
the PEB module list (DLL hollowing / module stomping)
* Working-set scan: modified-code page detection viaK32QueryWorkingSetEx,batchedwith one syscall per region instead
of one per 4 KB page (≈ 50-100× faster than the naïve loop)
* Private RWX detection: flagsMEM_PRIVATE + PAGE_EXECUTE_*(it produces FP results)
allocations (shellcode, JIT spray, dynamic code stub allocations)
* Hook-prologue probe— reads the first 16 bytes of each private code
page and matches classic x86/x64 trampolines:E9 ?? ?? ?? ??—JMP rel32FF 25 ?? ?? ?? ??—JMP [rip+disp32]68 ?? ?? ?? ?? C3—PUSH imm32 ; RET48 B8 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? FF E0—MOV RAX, imm64 ; JMP RAX49 BB ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? 41 FF E3— Detours-styleMOV R11, imm64 ; JMP R11
* E9 ?? ?? ?? ??—JMP rel32
* FF 25 ?? ?? ?? ??—JMP [rip+disp32]
* 68 ?? ?? ?? ?? C3—PUSH imm32 ; RET
* 48 B8 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? FF E0—MOV RAX, imm64 ; JMP RAX
* 49 BB ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? 41 FF E3— Detours-styleMOV R11, imm64 ; JMP R11
* CLR detection— section-object probe forCor_Private_IPCBlock_v4_<PID>andthe v2Cor_Private_IPCBlock_<PID>(legacy .NET 2/3 / mscorwks),
so noisy app-pools running old runtimes are not misclassified

### Thread Start-Address Validation (TSAV / L8)

Aether checks threads with stricter classification and
cross-correlation against the L1–L5 findings. For every created thread in the
target process Aether reads itsWin32StartAddressviaNtQueryInformationThreadand, when access permits, also the liveRip/EipviaGetThreadContext/Wow64GetThreadContext.
Each address is then graded as the following table, for more details read the blogpost:

Verdict

Severity

Condition

TSAV_SHELLCODE_PRIVATE

CRITICAL

Address lives in a 
MEM_PRIVATE + PAGE_EXECUTE_*
 region — classic 
CreateRemoteThread
 shellcode

TSAV_SUSPENDED_RIP

CRITICAL

Suspended thread's 
Rip
 disagrees with 
Win32StartAddress
 and resolves to a suspicious region — catches 
Win32StartAddress
 spoofing (EarlyBird / APC tricks) and 
SetThreadContext
 hijacks

TSAV_HOLLOWED_HOST

HIGH

Address inside a 
MEM_IMAGE
 allocation that is not in the PEB module list (DLL hollowing / module stomping)

TSAV_MODIFIED_HOST

HIGH

Address inside a 
MEM_IMAGE
 allocation that the L1–L5 pipeline already flagged as 
MODIFIED_CODE_*
, 
MISSING_PEB
, 
PRIVATE_RWX
, 
DISK_MEM_DIFF
, or 
HOOK_PROLOGUE

TSAV_STAGED_PRIVATE_RW

HIGH

MEM_PRIVATE + PAGE_READWRITE
 — pre-
VirtualProtect
 shellcode staging

TSAV_MAPPED_NONPE

MEDIUM

MEM_MAPPED
 (pagefile-backed section) without a PE header — sRDI / pagefile reflective loader

TSAV_SPOOF_TRAMPOLINE

MEDIUM

Address matches a denylisted trampoline (
LoadLibraryA/W/ExA/W
, 
WinExec
, 
CreateProcessA/W
, 
VirtualAlloc[Ex]
, 
RtlExitUserThread
, 
RtlExitUserProcess
, 
NtTerminateProcess
, 
ShellExecuteA/W
)

What makes this stronger than the basic check "is start_address in any module"
check:

* VirtualQueryExcross-check— every address is queried forType/Protect/AllocationBasein a single O(1) call instead of a linear
scan over the module list
* Cross-correlation with L1–L5— a thread whose start lands inside an
already-flagged allocation is upgraded from "OK" toTSAV_MODIFIED_HOST
* PEB consistency— hollowed modules are detected even when the start
address technically falls inside a "real" range
* Suspended-RIP probe—Win32StartAddressis process-writable viaNtSetInformationThreadand is the spoofable field; the liveRipof a
suspended thread is the one a loader can't easily rewrite. We compare
the two and flag any disagreement that resolves to a suspicious region
* WoW64 aware— automatically switches toWow64GetThreadContextand
readsEipfor 32-bit threads inside a 64-bit process
* Access-rights ladder— falls back fromQUERY_INFORMATION | GET_CONTEXT→QUERY_INFORMATION→QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATIONper
thread, so partial-access scenarios still produce useful classifications

### Entropy analysis & Shellcode heuristics

Aether supports XOR detection pattern at stub level for now and adopt Shannon entropy alogrithm to check randomness of byte values in memory region, it flags everything above a threshold. to address high amount of FP, Aether uses multiple indicators.

### C2 Beacon Detection

* TCP connection monitoring— pollsGetExtendedTcpTablefor a target PID
* Beacon pattern detection— identifies periodic short-lived connections
(classic C2 callback behavior)
* Connection table output— formatted console table with state, endpoint,
hits, and protocol

### Output Modes

* Colored console reportwith severity-based ANSI highlighting
* Machine-parseable JSONfor SIEM / d-tect.py pipeline integration
* Graded suspicion output— eachMODIFIED_CODE_*finding carriesprivate_pagesandregion_pagesso triage has the actual numbers
* Table-formatted outputusing Unicode box-drawing characters for
connection monitoring

With--verboseyou also see per-thread detail and recovered XOR keys:

 [!] TID:8476 MODIFIED_HOST start=0x1D6E0001A80 host=msi.dll

The recovered key bytes can be passed to a one-liner (python -c 'import sys; k=bytes.fromhex("AABBCCDD"); d=sys.stdin.buffer.read(); sys.stdout. buffer.write(bytes(b^k[i%len(k)] for i,b in enumerate(d)))') to dump
the decrypted PE for analysis.

## How to Compile

### Prerequisites

* Zig 0.16—download here
* Cross-compilation works from any host OS (Linux, macOS, Windows)

### Build

git clone https://github.com/0xsp-SRD/aether

cd
 aether

#
 Debug build (safety checks enabled)

zig build

#
 Release build (smaller, faster binary)

zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe

#
 or

zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast

The built executable lands inzig-out/bin/Aether.exe.

### Deploy

Copyzig-out/bin/Aether.exeand therules/directory to the target
Windows machine if you want to perform additional signature scan. if the target process requires Administrative privileges, you need to run Aether.exe with Administrator privileges.

## Limitations

* Usermode only— no kernel driver; cannot detect rootkits or
kernel-level manipulations
* IPv4 only— TCP connection monitoring does not support IPv6 endpoints for now.
* L5 disk diff requires file access— if the original module file has
been deleted or is locked, the on-disk diff silently skips that module
(other layers still run)
* TSAV spoof-trampoline list resolves in the scanner's own process—
catches the common case where system DLLs share an ASLR base session-wide
but may miss targets with unique per-process bases (rare on Win10+)
* TSAV RIP probe only catches suspended threads— aWin32StartAddressrewrite on an already-running thread can only be detected if the thread
happens to be parked in a wait when probed (same constraint as Moneta)
* XOR-PE detection is basic on this release
